Days after the announcement, Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge on 18th December launched the campaign in New Delhi. Incidentally, the links for the Congress crowdfunding campaign land the donors on BJP’s donation page. It has come to light that the funds and donations through the Congress party’s campaign are adding to the Bharatiya Janata Party’s coffers. As per reports, the grand old party kicked off the crowdfunding campaign without registering the related domain names. Reports add that the BJP secured the website domains after Congress failed to register the relevant domains for the donation websites promoted in its fundraising campaign.The links redirected the donors to BJP and OPIndia’s donation pages. Simply put, when a person opens the Donatefordesh.org website, the user is redirected to BJP’s donation page which seeks details like donors’ name, mobile number, and email ID.Congress launches #DonateForDesh campaign but fails to book important domain. BJP bought it & redirected it on their website Check out 👉 https://t.co/EzdIREg5YC pic.twitter.com/uiWRqOhU4qSimilarly Donatefordesh.com and Donatefordesh.in take the user to the OpIndia Support pages. 😭😂😂 pic.twitter.com/3gkO2fpSVBCongress launched #DonateForDesh campaign.But it failed to book important domain names.So,BJP bought https://t.co/F3NcbFxDZc 😛Now after the campaign,@RahulGandhi will blame Adani for the donations happened to BJP 😂 pic.twitter.com/TyQh5cbvnYFollowing the goof-up in crowdfunding, netizens have been taking a jibe at the Congress party calling it the grand old party’s moye-moye moment. Netizens have slammed Congress asking the grand old party if it didn’t have any domain for these websites why it kicked off the campaign prematurely. I have been dealing in domains and hosting since 2003. It has been over 20 years. I have never seen someone so irresponsible as @INCIndia, who started a nationwide campaign by the name ""#DonateForDesh"" but forgot to register TLDs, including .com and .org. Check the domains below…Several users called it a major failure of the IT department of Congress party. According to several Twitter users, the failure alludes to the callous or non-serious approach of the party for its own crowdfunding campaign as otherwise, it had enough time and resources to run basic errands.I mean by their own admission, idiots had 2 days to book at least the .org or .in domain name, but they didn't. Has Congress got ""Donate for Desh"" as a trademark? If their alliance called be called INDIA, we can ask money too for DonateForDesh https://t.co/eXPfnV1VNoPlease don’t blame Shrieking Jane for the fiasco of Congress’s ‘Donate for Desh’ fraud. She has to not only appear less intelligent than Rahul Gandhi but also prove it. 😂Let alone domains, the Congress didn’t even block SM accounts. Check out @donatefordesh, for instance.और…However, it’s not that Congress hasn’t received donations in the last few years. In 2021-22, the party received donations totaling ₹95 crore through electoral bonds. Additionally, in September 2023, the Congress announced that it possesses assets worth about ₹700 crores.Nonetheless, the Congress party will be collecting donations both online and offline. On December 28, 2023, the party is celebrating its 138th anniversary. In alignment with that, it has issued an appeal to its supporters to contribute in multiples of ₹138, while urging its district and state-level workers to donate ₹1380.The campaign has been initiated by its president, Mallikarjun Kharge, who has donated ₹1.38 lakh to the party. Congress will conduct this campaign online until December 28, 2023, following which its workers will go door-to-door to collect donations. However, the crowdfunding campaign has been marred with a major setback and failure for the party’s IT department as it lost the race for website domains to BJP and OpIndia. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"18 December, 2023 ",‘Hamid Ansari used to help gangster Mukhtar Ansari despite being the Vice President’: BJP MLA Sushil Singh,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/hamid-ansari-used-to-help-gangster-mukhtar-despite-being-vice-president-bjp-mla-sushil-singh/,"Sushil Singh further added that Mukhtar Ansari, along with his political patrons like SP and Congress, not only got his opponents murdered, but also used to break them mentally by filing many cases against them. On 15th December (Friday), a Varanasi MP/MLA court sentenced mafia-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari to five and a half years in prison for threatening a witness in the kidnapping of the Vishva Hindu Parishad treasurer. The court also imposed a fine of Rs 10,000 on Ansari for threatening Mahavir Prasad Rungta, the brother of coal businessman and VHP treasurer Nand Kishore Rungta, who was kidnapped by Ansari’s henchman from his Varanasi office on 22nd January 1997. This was the jailed mafia’s seventh conviction since September last year. Ansari, who appeared through video conferencing, was visibly upset after hearing the ruling. Reportedly he began pleading with the judge. When Judge Ujjwal Upadhyay started pronouncing the sentence, Ansari sat with his head down and his hands on his forehead. Following this, he pleaded before the judge, saying, ‘Judge Sahab, please have mercy so that all my sentences proceed simultaneously.’ However, in the decision given by the court, it was already mentioned. Notably, Nand Kishore Rungta, a coal businessman from Jawahar Nagar of Bhelupur police station area of Varanasi, was murdered after being kidnapped on 22nd January 1997. Reports say that Nand Kishore was killed even after the family paid a ransom of Rs 1.25 crore to the kidnapper. After this, on the evening of 5th November 1997, Nand Kishore Rungta’s brother Mahavir Prasad Rungta, a witness in the case, and his family received bomb threats on his landline not to file a complaint with the police.However, the victim’s family lodged an FIR in the Bhelupur police station of Varanasi in which the court pronounced its verdict. Strikingly, in May this year, the OpIndia team visited several districts in Purvanchal that faced the severe brunt of violence at the hands of Ansari and his henchman. During the visit, OpIndia spoke with BJP MLA Sushil Singh who made several shocking claims and called Mukhtar a traitor.It is important to note that different courts have served Mukhtar Ansari with punishment ranging from 2 years to life imprisonment in different cases. At present, hearings are underway in courts for 21 out of the 65 cases registered against him. He is currently lodged in Banda jail and is being kept under strict surveillance.In May, the OpIndia team had visited various districts of Purvanchal including Varanasi, Mau, Ghazipur, and Chandauli. These districts were once badly affected by the crimes of Mukhtar Ansari. During this Purvanchal tour, the OpIndia team met Sushil Singh, BJP MLA from Chandauli’s Saidaraja Assembly.Speaking with OpIndia, BJP MLA Sushil Singh had said that Mukhtar Ansari is not only a criminal but also a traitor. He asserted that Mukhtar Ansari not only committed various crimes but also committed offenses like stealing the army’s LMG (Light Machine Gun). Notably, Ansari reportedly bought the army’s LMG (Light Machine Gun) from an Army deserter in 2004 to penetrate Krishnanand Rai’s bullet-proof SUV.BJP MLA Sushil further told OpIndia that Mukhtar and his family have been involved in crime along with politics. He said that Mukhtar continued committing crimes because no one in his family suffered untimely death as a cost of his criminal enterprise, haece he doesn’t know how it feels to pay the price of violence. BJP MLA Sushil Singh told OpIndia that Mukhtar Ansari got at least 100 of his political opponents killed. It is alleged that these murders continued unabated under the patronage of the Samajwadi Party government. According to Sushil Singh, Mukhtar Ansari primarily targeted Hindus, orchestrating plans in which Hindus killed Hindus.BJP MLA Sushil Singh added that while the Samajwadi Party shielded and advocated the crimes of Mukhtar Ansari from Lucknow, the Congress did the same and protected him from Delhi. According to Sushil Singh, the Congress Party had imposed MCOCA on Mukhtar’s entire family at the latter’s instructions.Naming the then Vice President Hamid Ansari, the BJP MLA Singh alleged that Hamid Ansari used to lobby for Mukhtar by dialing the police station. Additionally, Hamid Ansari also missed his powers to register cases at the police station against those who stood against Mukhtar.Sushil Singh further added that Mukhtar Ansari, along with his political patrons like SP and Congress, not only got his opponents murdered, but also used to break them mentally by filing many cases against them. Sushil Singh noted that even in this bad time, he got the support of Narendra Modi and Yogi Adityanath, based on which he continued his struggle against Mukhtar Ansari.Speaking with OpIndia, BJP MLA Sushil Singh became emotional. He said that his innocent uncle Satish Singh, a farmer, was also murdered by Mukhtar Ansari. According to Sushil Singh, the murder was carried out to instill fear in the minds of people. He added that the murder of Krishnanand Rai was also done by Mukhtar Ansari to create terror.Recalling the year 2004, Sushil Singh mentioned that during Manoj Sinha’s Lok Sabha election campaign in Ghazipur, he had visited the area for campaigning. He claimed that the police had surrounded him intending to harm him. After leaving, several BJP workers were apprehended, held in the police station, and subjected to torture. According to him, he survived because of God’s grace. Sushil Singh also recalled the 2009 elections when there was a contest in the Lok Sabha elections in Varanasi between BJP’s Murli Manohar Joshi and Mukhtar Ansari. At that time, Sushil Singh was an MLA from the Bahujan Samaj Party.He alleges that, at Mukhtar Ansari’s behest, Mayawati imposed numerous cases on him overnight. According to him, this was done so that Sushil Singh could be murdered in the future. He admitted that at that time he was opposing Mukhtar Ansari and supporting Murli Manohar Joshi for Hindutva.BJP MLA Sushil Singh had claimed that even though the mafia don Mukhtar Ansari has become weak due to the change of government, the roots of his crime empire are still spread across UP. Sushil Singh admitted that many victims are still hesitant to come out due to fear of Mukhtar.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"18 December, 2023 ",Half of Bengal’s population will one day speak Urdu: Old video of Kolkata Mayor thanking Mamata Banerjee for making it second language goes viral,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/old-video-kolkata-mayor-firhad-hakim-urdu-propehcy-half-population-west-bengal-viral/,"In February 2012, Mamata Banerjee made Urdu the second language in areas of West Bengal where the population of Urdu speakers was equal or more than 10%.On Saturday (16th December), a video of incumbent Kolkata Mayor Firhad Hakim endorsing Urduisation of West Bengal went viral on social media.In a video shared on X (formerly Twitter) by user ‘Mintu Roy’, Hakim was heard saying, “Inshallah, one day will come when half of the population of Bengal will speak Urdu and recite poetry.” His remark aimed at the promotion of Urdu in West Bengal was greeted with applause by Muslims present at the event. It must be mentioned that Bengalis have a history of resisting the imposition of non-native languages particularly Urdu. Watch the video👇 pic.twitter.com/sXzRjE4yuBIn fact, one of the reasons leading up to the Bangladesh Liberation War was the imposition of Urdu over Bengali in then-East Pakistan. As such, the prophecy by Kolkata Mayor that half of the State of West Bengal will one day speak in Urdu was meant to spark controversy. The viral video of Firhad Hakim was recorded on 11th February 2021 during an event hosted by the West Bengal Urdu Academy.During the event dubbed ‘Mushaira 2021’, he was heard saying, “There was a time when Urdu speakers did not feel like they belonged to Bengal. There was no official status for Urdu. I want to thank Mamata Banerjee for making Urdu the second official language of Bengal.”“We have increased the budget of the Urdu Academy to ₹15 crore,” he informed. Firhad Hakim said that his ancestors came from Bihar and spoke Urdu at home. He also called upon the West Bengal Urdu Academy to take measures to propagate the language in the State of West Bengal.It must be mentioned that Mamata Banerjee engaged in appeasement politics soon after becoming the Chief Minister of West Bengal in 2011. A year later in February 2012, she made Urdu the second language in areas of the State where Urdu speakers were equal to or more than 10% of the population.The Trinamool Congress government had identified a total of 18 such Urdu-speaking areas -Goalpokhar I and II blocks, Islalmpur block, Kolkata Municipal Corporation, Islampur Municipality, Garulia Municipality, Titagarh Municipality, Kamarhati Municipality, Bhatpara Municipality, Champdani Municipality, Bansberia Municipality, Bhadreswar Municipality, Rishra Municipality, Asansol Municipal Corporation, Jamuria Municipality, Raniganj Municipality, Kulti Municipality and Bally Municipality.However, this is not the first time when the Mayor of Kolkata has been in the news for the wrong reasons. In April 2016, he had dubbed a Muslim-dominated area of Kolkata as ‘Mini-Pakistan‘ In February 2021, he was spotted delivering a political speech at a masjid in Kolkata, in blatant violation of the Model Code of Conduct. To pacify Muslim rioters during the anti-CAA movement, Firhad Hakim referred to them as ‘brothers.’ The Kolkata Mayor was earlier seen referring to the Central Armed forces and the BJP as ‘Suar er baccha‘ (progency of pigs).Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"18 December, 2023 ","Ashok Gehlot ruined Rajasthan’s economy, left a debt of Rs 5.37 lakh crore on the state, failed to boost GDP",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/ashok-gehlot-rajasthans-economy-left-a-debt-of-rs-5-37-lakh-crore-on-the-state-failed-to-boost-gdp/,"Rajasthan is presently drowning in debt. A report by the Reserve Bank of India shows that Rajasthan has a debt of Rs 5.37 lakh crore by the end of the financial year 2022-23. This debt was only Rs 2.81 lakh crore in 2018 when Ashok Gehlot took over the office. Ashok Gehlot has imposed a new loan of Rs 2.55 lakh crore on Rajasthan in the last five years.The state of Rajasthan welcomed its new Chief Minister Bhajanlal Sharma last week. Sharma took the oath of office as Rajasthan’s 16th chief minister. Additionally, he’s made some important decisions. But much remains to be done, particularly because Rajasthan’s economy suffered considerable harm due to the previous Congress administration under Ashok Gehlot.In Rajasthan, changing the government every five years has become a trend for the past thirty years. Nevertheless, the state’s economy has suffered each time the Congress government has taken office. The statistics indicate the same thing this time around.Although Rajasthan has one of the highest debt-to-GDP ratios in the nation and a massive debt load, its GDP has not increased significantly over the previous five years. Apart from this, the Gehlot government’s profligacy has left the state in the throes of a severe economic crisis.Rajasthan is presently drowning in debt.

Ashok Gehlot has imposed a new loan of Rs 2.55 lakh crore on Rajasthan in the last five years.The Congress government looted the government treasury continuously to bring in new appeasement schemes and get votes. It is noteworthy that Ashok Gehlot referred to the Rs 1.63 lakh crore loan taken by the previous Vasundhara Raje government as extremely high when he took office in 2018. He is now the one who has buried the state in debt.Rajasthan’s financial situation is appalling. This state’s debt amounts to 40% of its GDP. It shouldn’t go over 20% in any state, according to the FRBM Act, which establishes borrowing caps for the federal government and the states. However, it has doubled as a result of the Congress government’s extravagant spending.It’s not like accepting this loan would have allowed Ashok Gehlot to propel the state’s development in a new direction. Conversely, the economy of Rajasthan has expanded at a fairly normal rate during his tenure. When the state’s Congress government left office in 2013, Rajasthan’s GDP was Rs 4.93 lakh crore.Under the BJP government, it rose to Rs 6.28 lakh crore by 2018. Following this, the state’s GDP was Rs 7.99 lakh crore in 2023 compared to 2018. Over these two periods, the state’s GDP grew by 27.2%. Yet, the Congress government borrowed far more money to achieve the same growth.The Congress government has indulged in careless expenses to carry on its appeasement policies over the last 5 years. The difference between the state’s revenue and expenses, or the fiscal deficit, has grown dramatically over the previous five years. It was Rs 25,342 crore in 2018, the year the BJP government was forced to resign, and it has more than doubled to Rs 58,212 crore when Ashok Gehlot leaves office in 2023. This represents 4.3% of the GDP of Rajasthan. The rule says it should not exceed 3%.Ashok Gehlot has left office after taking the state’s economy on a nosedive. Under these circumstances, Bhajanlal Sharma, the new chief minister, will need to exercise extreme caution. He will need to pay back debts while simultaneously bringing the economy back to life. Apart from this, strengthening law and order will be critical to the growth of the economy.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

When the state’s Congress government left office in 2013, Rajasthan’s GDP was Rs 4.93 lakh crore.Under the BJP government, it rose to Rs 6.28 lakh crore by 2018. Following this, the state’s GDP was Rs 7.99 lakh crore in 2023 compared to 2018. Over these two periods, the state’s GDP grew by 27.2%. Yet, the Congress government borrowed far more money to achieve the same growth.The Congress government has indulged in careless expenses to carry on its appeasement policies over the last 5 years. The difference between the state’s revenue and expenses, or the fiscal deficit, has grown dramatically over the previous five years. It was Rs 25,342 crore in 2018, the year the BJP government was forced to resign, and it has more than doubled to Rs 58,212 crore when Ashok Gehlot leaves office in 2023. This represents 4.3% of the GDP of Rajasthan. The rule says it should not exceed 3%.Ashok Gehlot has left office after taking the state’s economy on a nosedive. Under these circumstances, Bhajanlal Sharma, the new chief minister, will need to exercise extreme caution. He will need to pay back debts while simultaneously bringing the economy back to life. Apart from this, strengthening law and order will be critical to the growth of the economy.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"14 December, 2023 ","N Ram pats his own back for a pompous, gassy editorial in The Hindu, The Wire has a monumental meltdown: Fallout of SC decision...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/n-ram-pompous-editorial-the-hindu-the-wire-meltdown-sc-decision-article-370/,"N.Ram, Siddarth Varadarajan and their ilk know very well that the Parliament can split or not split a state even when there is an elected government in place and the legislature wishes otherwise.On December 11th, the Supreme Court upheld the abolition of the dreaded Article 370 (I know it was repealed and therefore while Article 370 still exists in the Constitution, the original dreaded purpose for which it was intended doesn’t exist anymore). Certain sections of the English media; certain sections of the I.N.D.I alliance and the entire Congress party went bonkers over this decision of the Supreme Court. Watching their meltdowns gave me goosebumps, literally. Am sure that their WhatsApp groups buzzed with messages on what should be their best strategy on this topic. The line of argument they have chosen to bombard their readers/viewers is – Attack on Federalism! A long, pompous and gassy editorial was published in his newspaper, The Hindu (we will get it later in this article). N. Ram showed utmost humility and described his editorial as “clear-sighted and insightful”. A former CEO of The Hindu group of publications, Rajiv C. Lochan, dared to call out this humility of N.Ram on Twitter here (“Beware when one pats one’s own back”. He went on to comment that “the pervasive use of adjectives can’t strengthen a relatively weak set of arguments”. Rajiv Lochan was telling N. Ram that just because he used good English doesn’t mean that this editorial is insightful. Now, the unparalleled arrogance of N. Ram is well known. Occasionally he takes it upon himself to prove it yet again to all his readers. Rajiv Lochan provided the best opportunity for N. Ram to exhibit his famed arrogance and intolerance in public. True to his image, N. Ram use a lot of English words to convey a simple meaning. I would urge you to read the image below and have a hearty laugh at N. Ram’s meltdown! He is telling Rajiv Lochan that a mere CEO should shut up because there is no one better than N.Ram to have opinions in this whole world. How can a mere CEO comment in public about matters as trivial as Article 370? Imagine N. Ram’s attitude towards mere citizens if he goes bombastic like this on his former CEO! After reading the “clear-sighted and insightful” editorial about 3 to 5 times, I was able to find 2 sentences that summarized the arguments of the entire English media gang. The title of the editorial makes it sound like doomsday is near and we will die because of what the Supreme Court did! I have highlighted the relevant portion in the editorial that tells us that Parliament can now do anything while keeping a state under the President’s rule. This was what his compatriots at The Wire were also shrieking about. The meltdown at The Wire was even more monumental in proportions. Multiple opinion pieces popped up in a short time – all telling us the same thing – that there is no difference left between “democracy and dictatorship”; that there are “Serious implications” for the entire country; that this is an “attack on the basic structure of federalism”; and the best of all – Many “locals had feared” that they have been pushed into “meaningful silence”!Think about what these people are writing folks. What is wrong with “meaningful silence”? What is wrong with anything that is classified as “meaningful”? How can you use the word “meaningful” as a consequence of having “fear” to want it? N.Ram, Siddarth Varadarajan and their ilk know very well that the Parliament can split or not split a state even when there is an elected government in place and the legislature wishes otherwise. When she was the CM of UP, Mayawati passed a resolution in the UP Assembly asking the centre to split into 4 states. The then Home Minister flatly rejected the resolution. The disastrous manner in which AP was split into TS and AP is still fresh in many minds. The AP Legislature resolved that the state should not be split. Did that stop Sonia Gandhi from taking a stand otherwise? Examples galore exist on this topic. Starting from 1956 when their hero Nehru suspended the first elected communist government in the world in Kerala using a “brute majority” in Parliament. We can further discuss the language of Articles 1,2 and 3 in the Constitution of India. It wouldn’t serve any purpose for these people. We are approaching 10 years of Modi government. Despite their wonderful knowledge of the English language, these editors and owners have not been able to find new words, in the past 10 years, to describe their contempt towards the people of India for electing Modi. By rehashing the same words, and in the garb of being “insightful” and “clear-sighted”, all that these people have succeeded in was to show us how blinded they are to the reality of a new emerging Bharat. A Bharat that will embrace all meaningful decisions and leave behind all the meaningless trash these people dish out every day. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"13 December, 2023 ","As TV reporters shamelessly fight for smoke canister thrown in Parliament, here are a few things we should all be worried about after witnessing...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/journalists-fight-colour-canister-parliament-few-things-we-should-be-worried-about/,"If one truly thinks about it, the current TV journalists are merely following the standards set by veteran journalists like Rajdeep Sardesai who admitted that they were like vultures. On the 13th of December 2023, there was a serious security breach in the Parliament of India. Two individuals hurled a smoke canister from the viewer gallery. They then jumped to the floor of the house and were trying to make their way towards the speaker when were overpowered by parliamentarians. Thereafter they were detained by the police and taken for interrogation. Just as the security breach took place, there were two individuals outside the parliament protesting with similar colour smoke canisters. According to preliminary information from the Delhi Police, there is no terror angle to the incidents, however, the police are taking the breach seriously. According to reports, the intruder inside the parliament was chanting slogans about “Kaala Kanoon” and the protestors outside the Parliament were chanting slogans like Jai Bhim, Tanashahi Nahi Chalegi, Manipur ko Insaf do, etc. While the country was shocked by the serious security breach and the ramifications of the lapse, Indian media was conducting their very own circus. A video emerged where TV journalists were seen fighting like animals over the smoke canister that was hurled by the protestors. In the video put out by TV9, their journalist was showing the smoke canister on camera. While he was doing his segment, other journalists started trying to snatch the canister saying that he had used it enough and should hand over the canister to other journalists. When the other journalists started trying to snatch the canister, the TV9 journalist was seen almost sprinting with it, trying to get a few more seconds with the canister – for the sake of the hard-hitting coverage of the unfolding incident at the Parliament. As the nation had important questions that the media should have been focussing on – like how this security breach took place, who were the intruders, what were they chanting, why they did what they did, what was the police doing and how visitors entered the parliament with canisters and why were the Delhi Police so lackadaisical in arrested the protestors outside the Parliament, almost looking like they were taking them for a walk, these elements in the media seemed far more interested in ridiculous sensationalism and showing visuals of the canister. While we watched this circus unfold, there are several important aspects that people need to be extremely worried about. First and foremost, one has to wonder about the priorities of the media and what they choose to cover when important events unfold. As mentioned, there are very important questions that need to be answered as this security breach unfolds. The Parliament is not just a building but a symbol of the democracy of India and the seat of power. Any attack on the Parliament is an attack on democracy and the sovereignty of India itself. While these events unfolded, the journalists on the ground should have been far more focused on bringing crucial details to the people of the nation. And while several journalists were doing so, some were indulging in cheap sensationalism. This, however, comes as no surprise. One is reminded of the time when Rajdeep Sardesai was talking about the 2001 Parliament Attack – the terrorist attack that incidentally took place on this day 22 years ago. In 2018, a video had gone viral where Rajdeep Sardesai admitted that journalists were vultures. Sardesai in the video recounted the December 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament where he and his crew were preparing for a picnic owing to a slow news day. Preparing for a feast in the garden near the Parliament, he and his team entered the Parliament at around 11 am. Within minutes of the team entering the Parliament, he says they heard gunshots. The Parliament was attacked. He then recalled that when his colleague asked him to leave, he directed him to suggest the guard to close the gates. He explained with a wide grin that he did so so that no other channel crew could enter. Those days there were fewer channels and Sardesai was excited at the prospect of doing an exclusive story.He then says how the exclusive story of the parliament attack made the team forget the wine and kababs they were planning to picnic on. “It was a great day. We are like vultures. We feed on these moments.” he added.If one truly thinks about it, the current TV journalists are merely following the standards set by veteran vultures like Rajdeep Sardesai. While the conduct of the media was abysmal, what is far more concerning is the conduct of the Delhi Police and security agencies. When a security breach like this has taken place, one would imagine that the police and law enforcement agencies would ask the media to stand back – after all, 26/11 was a classic case of how the media could potentially jeopardise any rescue operation and investigation when such incidents take place. During the Mumbai Attack, the police allowed unbridled access to the media, resulting in journalists like Barkha Dutt potentially giving away crucial information on hostages from ISI handlers who were closely monitoring the media. Taking a lesson from the past, the police should have summarily kept the media away. That canister itself could be crucial evidence that the police need, instead, the media was yet again given unbridled access to play with the canister as if were some sort of a prop in a drama. On the 22nd anniversary of the ghastly 2001 Parliament attack, the parliament was under severe threat. There were Khalistani and other terror organisations which had issued threats against the Parliament. While now the police are claiming that the smoke was not harmful, while the breach was ongoing, the police had to function under the assumption that it could be a deadly terror attack which could have dire ramifications. Despite that, the media was given unbridled access knowing fully well that such media has a history of creating a circus during serious incidents. Several other questions are being raised against the police as the Parliament’s security was breached. Visitors to the Parliament are frisked at every stage and there are now questions being asked as to how the security could have been so wanting that two individuals with smoke canisters could enter the Parliament. Per protocol, those who have passes to view the Parliament proceedings are not allowed to carry a paper inside the Parliament. Legitimate concerns are now being raised as to how, amid such tight security, two individuals could enter with these canisters. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"11 December, 2023 ",Chadar of sanitised history over ugly side of ‘Sufi saints’: I got death threats by Islamists for talking about historical facts – so let...,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/nupur-j-sharma-moinuddin-chisti-sufi-saints-demand-arrest-threats-statement/,"Since the Islamists have been relentlessly demanding my arrest, I must place on record that if needed, I will be more than willing to defend my position in a court of law.On the 2nd of December, I interviewed the Son of Hamas – Mosab Hassan Yousef. He is the son of one of the founders of Hamas Sheikh Hassan Yousef. The interview was necessitated after a Hindu boy from Kashmir started getting Sar Tan Se Juda threats after he shared an old interview snippet of Yousef, where he was talking about Islam. After the boy from NIT Srinagar was threatened by the Islamist mob, Yousef took to his X page and posted that the Jihadis should go after him and leave the boy alone. In his interview with me, he categorically said that if anyone touched the Hindu boy, the repercussions would be dire. Beyond the NIT Srinagar case, Yousef and I also spoke at length about Islam, Islamism and the fate of the rest of the world in the face of a cult that was perpetually offended and believed that the use of violence to express that offence was their divine right – nay – duty. During the discussion, Yousef mentioned how Sufism was one of the most peaceful, spiritual branches of Islam. A Hindu, however, knows that this statement rings hollow. I told Yousef that as a Hindu, I find it difficult to make sense of that perception since Hindus have been raped and murdered by Sufis. As an example of the Sufi onslaught against Hindus, I cited the example of Moinuddin Chisti, how cows were slaughtered and Hindu Temples desecrated and also alluded to the Ajmer Dargah rape scandal where the self-proclaimed descendants of Moinuddin Chisti and the custodians of his legacy raped hundreds of Hindu girls and blackmailed them – a sordid saga from 1992. It is pertinent to mention here that I don’t blame Mosab Hassan Yousef for the views he holds on Sufism. Many Hindus themselves believe that Sufism is peaceful and spiritual. In fact, a chunk of the business that the Amer Dargah gets is from Hindus who visit the shrine – not Muslims. Even though it was some of the Chistis associated with the Ajmer Dargah who had issued death threats to Nupur Sharma and called for her beheading. Khadim Gauhar Chishti of Ajmer Dargah had links to Kanhaiya Lal’s murder. Khadim of Ajmer Dargah named Gauhar Chishti had met one of the killers of the Hindu tailor. Ajmer Dargah Khadim Salman Chishti threatened to kill Nupur Sharma. The history-sheeter with over 13 cases filed against him, including murder and attempt to murder, claimed that he would hand over his house to anyone who brings Sharma’s head. Sarwar Chishti of the Anjuman Committee of the Ajmer dargah had said “The situation in the country right now, is such that people are committing blasphemy. They are doing mischief in the glory of the Prophet, in the glory of the Khwaja. We will not tolerate this at all. We will launch such a massive agitation that the whole Hindustan will shake.” Sarwar Chishti had called himself a member of the PFI. In 2020, he defended PFI saying the organisation was ”saving India’s constitution”. He had also called for a boycott of Hindus. Syed Aadil Chishti – son of Sarwar Chishti – mocked Hindu deities after the Nupur Sharma incident.Nothing I said was historically inaccurate and I will come to that. Days after the interview, a clip where I mentioned Moinuddin Chisti was shared on social media by Islamists, claiming that I had insulted the Sufi ‘saint’ and I should be arrested. What started with the hashtag #ArrestNupurJSharma soon turned into a free-for-all – I got death threats, rape threats and the usual ‘Sar Tan se Juda’ threats. My reaction was the chuckle at the irony of it all. After all, my statement came just as it was being claimed that Sufis are peaceful and spiritual – a model for all Muslims to follow. Here is a sneak peak into their spiritual moorings: While the peaceful Sufis demanded for my head and arrest, I held my peace for 3 days – not because I was scared but because I believed that their outrage would die down. It did not. I believe sunlight is the best disinfectant. I believe the truth – historical facts – can’t be suppressed simply because some people are offended by it. As an American conservative says, ‘facts don’t care about your feelings’. I have repeated over and over again the purpose of my professional existence – I picked up my pen because ‘they’ sold theirs. I would not do justice to my role or my readers if I don’t stand by the truth. If I cower today. And therefore, I feel it necessary to substantiate my statement with historical evidence. With regards to Sufism, there is a broad perception that it is a peaceful, spiritual sect of Islam. However, there are certain myths attached to this notion that need honest conversation. Historically, several genocides against Hindus and crimes against their faith/places of worship have been led by Sufis or have been conducted at the behest of Sufis. It is a matter of historical record that eighteenth-century Sufi preacher Shah Waliullah’s letters to Islamic rulers and nobles show that he was very keen on rejuvenating Islamic supremacy in Delhi, which had started to loosen its grip over the sub-continent after Aurangzeb’s death. According to the book by Saiyid Athar Abbas Rizvi, Shah Waliullah wrote a letter to Ahmad Shah Abdali, the invader from Afghanistan, inviting him to India to establish Islamic supremacy by suppressing Hindus.From the invite to Ahmad Shah Abdali to the mastermind of the Noakhali genocide belonging to a Sufi sect – Shah Syed Gholam Sarwar Husseini, the hereditary pir of Dayra Sharif, a Sufi shrine in Noakhali, Sufism has a chequered history – one which is well documented – a history of genocide, enslavement, forced conversion and establishment of the supremacy of Islam. Those Sufis who refused to adhere to Orthodox Islam were persecuted – the sects we talk about today were not. MA Khan writes that Sufi leaders had poured into India along with the Turkic invaders and most of them, Nizamuddin Aulia, Aamir Khasrau, Nasiruddin Chiragh, Moinuddin Chishti and Jalaluddin etc, were all known for holding the Ulemas, orthodox Islamic scholars in high esteem. Khan further writes that though Nizamuddin Aulia and Moinuddin Chishti were among the most unorthodox when it came to music and dance, in the matters of Islam and Islamic supremacy, they held the words of the Ulema as sacrosanct. “What the Ulema seeks to achieve through speech, the Sufis achieve by behaviour,” Nizamuddin Aulia had said.The great Sufi saint Nasiruddin Chiragh had reportedly banned all practices that were deviant from the Sharia. Khan quotes Prof KA Nizami to describe what the Sufi leader Ghazzali had told in terms of Jihad, the Islamic religious war against Kafirs. Ghazzali had written that his followers must go on Jihad at least once a year and should bring down the fortresses of non-Muslims, they should cut down their throats drown them and burn their holy books. Jihadists may take whatever booty they desire. Toeing the orthodox line, Nizamuddin Aulia had condemned the Hindus of India to the ‘fires of hell’. He had also written that even if non-Muslims embrace Islam, the faith will not benefit them, because they had been unbelievers. He had added, “He, (Allah) has created paradise and hell for the believers and the infidels respectively to repay the wicked they (infidels) have done.” Now, coming to the specific comments in question about Moinuddin Chisti – one made during an interview with the Son of Hamas – Mosab Hassan Yousef. It is necessary to place on record that in the full video interview uploaded on YouTube, the mention of Moinuddin Chisti had long been redacted. Let me explain why. When I asked the question about Sufism and Hindus, I intended to talk about the campaign of certain Sufis against Hindus – which has been documented throughout history – even as recently as 1992. In the video description, I have explained that when I spoke of rape, I was referring to the Ajmer Dargah Rape scandal where hundreds of Hindu girls were raped with the active connivance and participation of the Khadims of Ajmer Dargah – the Chistis – who claim to be the descendants of Moinuddin Chisti. Farooq Chisti was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2007, but in 2013, the Rajasthan High Court deemed he had served ‘enough’ time and therefore, released him. The Ajmer Dargah still associates itself with him and his local clout has remained intact. Nafis Chist was absconding until 2003, before being caught by the Delhi Police while trying to escape, wearing a burqa. He is currently out on bail and respected in a similar way in Ajmer. These are facts. In the second part of the question, I spoke about cows being slaughtered and thrown into Hindu temples. I also spoke about the desecration of Hindu temples and the Jihad waged by Moinuddin Chisti – this assertion is again documented in history. Here is an excerpt from the book “Islamic Jihad” by MA Khan. Khan writes further that every day, Khwaja’s followers used to bring a cow and they used to slaughter it near a prominent temple where the local Raja and Hindus used to pray, cook kebabs from the cow’s meat to eat, just to show contempt towards the local Hindus. Chishti had come to India to fight Jihad on the side of the Sultan Muhammad Ghauri against the Hindu King Prithviraj Chauhan. Chishti had credited himself for Prithviraj’s capture, writing, “We have seized Pithaura (Prithviraj) and handed him to the army of Islam.” In addition, this is what a previous version of the website of Ajmer Dargah itself said and I quote, “When he had settled down in Ajmer, the Khawaja Sahib had a special reminder about his marriage through a ‘Basharat’ (prophetic dream) from the Holy prophet sometime in 590 AH or 1193 AD. The Prophet said, “O Moinuddin, You are a great preceptor of our religion. You should not depart from our ‘sunnah’ (meaning marriage which is incumbent upon every Muslim under the laws of Shariat). Coincidentally that very night Malik-a-Khitab devotee of Hazrat Khawaja Sahib, had captured a Raja’s daughter in an encounter who embraced Islam and Khawaja sahib, in response to the above reminder, married her giving her the Islamic name of Bibi Ummutulla..” Here is an archive link to the page: https://web.archive.org/web/20180319103851/http://dargahajmer.com/married-life/ This is also substantiated in A History Of Sufism in India, Sayyad Athar Abbas Rizvi, Vol 1, pg. 124. However, since the snippet in the video was not an explainer and merely a question, I realized it may be misinterpreted and therefore, the mention of the individual was removed. It bodes well, however, to repeat on record that I stand by the rest of my statement. Since the Islamists have been relentlessly demanding my arrest, I must place on record that if needed, I will be more than willing to defend my position in a court of law.It is said that the most effective way to destroy people is to deny and obliterate their own understanding of their history. For what little my contribution is worth, I refuse to be a part of that obliteration – I will not be silenced. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

As per the subtitles in the video, she was seen saying that Islam is not compatible with European values and culture. Islam is being perpetrated (in Italy) through Saudi Arabia’s funding and Saudi Arabia has Sharia law. Meloni further says that the Sharia law is not compatible with Europian values and culture.

A number of Indian media houses including WION, Hindustan Times, Mint, NDTV, and Times Now reported the same claims. NDTV used a X post embed of a handle named Geopolitical Kid and wrote that Meloni’s statement was given during the political event organised by her party. However, Meloni’s statement regarding Islam’s alleged incompatibility wasn’t found in any international publications in the last 24-hour window. Radio Genoa, a popular handle on X, seemed to have first posted the video. Italian PM Giorgia Meloni: “I believe that there is a problem of compatibility between Islamic culture and the values ​​and rights of our civilization. The Islamic cultural centers in Italy are financed by Saudi Arabia where Sharia is in force. In Europe there is a very… pic.twitter.com/wEn8Fl4JC2However, Radio Genoa has not cited a time frame, and has not written that Meloni’s statement was recent. Upon searching with the keywords and comparing it with Meloni’s video clip going viral, we found that the original video was posted on YouTube back in 2018. The video was posted by the YouTube channel alanews in 2018. The original video can be seen here. In the video, Meloni is seen saying, “Salvini says that Islam is incompatible with the constitution? Ask him for clarification, but I believe that Islam certainly presents incompatibility with our values ​​and our civilization, and what happens in Islamic centers demonstrates this. This does not mean generalizing, but there is an incompatibility with our culture.”In that video, Meloni was referring to a previous statement by another conservative leader Matteo Salvini. Salvini, referring to the Cologne mass sexual attacks and Berlin terrorist attack, had said that Islam is incompatible with European values. Salvni is a leader of Italy’s Lega Nord party. Conclusion: While the viral video of Giorgia Meloni is mostly correct in rough translation, the video, or the statement, are not recent. They are from 5 years ago, and not from the recent political event organised by Meloni’s party. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"18 December, 2023 ",Fact Check: Did Pakistani caretaker PM confirm that unknown men poisoned Dawood Ibrahim? Here is the truth,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/fact-check-pakistani-caretaker-pm-dawood-ibrahim-death-confirmation/,"Dawood Ibrahim was designated as a global terrorist in 2003 by India and the United States with a reward of US$25 million for his capture for his believed role in the 1993 Bombay bombings. On Monday (18th December), social media was abuzz with rumours of the death of wanted terrorist Dawood Ibrahim, who has been hiding in Pakistan for decades. As per the rumours, Ibrahim was poisoned by an unknown person, and he was rushed to hospital. Some posts on social media claimed he was critical, while others claimed that he died. The rumours began spreading on Sunday (17th December) after Pakistan’s internet went down.Amid the rumours, an alleged screenshot of caretaker Prime Minister of Pakistan, Anwaar Ul Haq Kakar, went viral on social media with claims that the said post confirmed the death of Ibrahim. The post read, “The Messiah of humanity, dear to every Pakistani heart, our beloved His Excellency Dawood Ibrahim passed away due to poisoned by unknown. He breathed his last in a hospital in Karachi. May Allah grant him the highest position in Jannat. Inna Lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji’un.”However, when OpIndia investigated the screenshot and the official handle of the Pakistani PM, we found that there was no such tweet. Furthermore, the handle used in the screenshot was anwaar_kakkar, while the real ID of the Pakistani PM is anwaar_kakar. There is a handle called anwaar_kakkar, but that is a fan account of PM Kakar, and there was no such tweet either. It was evident that someone artificially created the post by adding text and a Grey Verified Check Mark on the fan account.Pakistani journalists also fuelled the rumours. In a recent episode of Bheja Fry, Pakistani journalist Aarzoo Kazmi talked about the rumours surrounding the poisoning of Dawood Ibrahim and his critical health in the hospital. She highlighted the fact that there was an internet shutdown in the country and emphasised that something was happening in Pakistan. She also talked about the rumours of Dawood Ibrahim’s poisoning and critical health. While she fanned the rumours, the rumours of Ibrahim’s death remained unconfirmed.As per Aaj Tak, Ibrahim was indeed admitted to the hospital two days back. It is unclear what was the reason, but several reports talked about the rumours of him being poisoned.Though the rumours of Ibrahim’s death remained unconfirmed, it was indeed a fact that internet services faced a massive crackdown in Pakistan on 17th December. Social media services and search engines stopped working without any prior notice. No one could access social media platforms like X, Facebook, YouTube, etc., and the Google search engine was down. While it was rumoured that the crackdown was because of the poisoning of Ibrahim, in reality, it appeared that the Pakistani government shut down the internet to limit the access and circulation of videos of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s virtual rally.Dawood Ibrahim is one of the most notorious and dreaded gangsters that India has ever seen. A criminal mobster and drug dealer in Mumbai. It is believed that he now resides in Karachi, Pakistan. He was designated as a global terrorist in 2003 by India and the United States with a reward of US$25 million for his capture for his believed role in the 1993 Bombay bombings. In 2011, the FBI and Forbes named him number three on The World’s 10 Most Wanted Fugitives.While Ibrahim’s death rumours are all over social media, it has to be noted that such rumours find their place on social media platforms once or twice every year. It is a fact that Ibrahim is hiding in Pakistan, and the hostile neighbour categorically refused to accept his presence in the country.OpIndia’s detailed report on terrorists being killed by unnamed assailants in Pakistan can be checked here.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

The X users circulated the visuals from the Gomti bridge with misleading claims that the authority scattered their goods and assaulted the vendors.

VIP movement traverses through this route because of which the  Municipal corporation and police regularly carry out anti-encroachment drives.”Misleading. @zoo_bear won't share that – vendors were asked to vacate no-vending zone several times before.

He added that the corporation had taken action previously, and the police had communicated with the vendors. East DCP Lucknow mentioned that today (17th December), the convoy of UP CM Yogi Adityanath also passed through this route. He added that today the dry fruit vendors showed indecency with the anti-encroachment team. Subsequently, when the police came to learn about the incident, they used the necessary force and brought the youths to the police station. They have been informed that this is a VIP route adding that they should cooperate with the anti-encroachment drives in the future as well.It is also notable that while the X users claimed police threw away the dry fruits being sold by the street vendors, others have said that the vendors themselves dropped the products on the streets after police asked them to vacate the place. Therefore, the police removed the street vendors not because of their identities as Kashmiris, but only because they were vending at an unauthorised place.

Looks like your newsroom is filled with Stalin fanbois from radical left universities.As per various Russian accounts, a whopping 20 million people are said to have perished under Joseph Stalin’s regime, after being at the receiving end of labour camps, forced collectivisation, famine and executions.Besides these measures, Stalin had also initially colluded with the Nazis during the latter’s Polish invasion in 1939 and at the end of the war, the Communist soldiers under Stalin have been alleged to have raped at least 2 million German women.In a century, communist states have killed approximately 100 million people, according to Ilya Somin’s articles. Joseph Stalin’s attempts to collectivise agriculture and production in Russia resulted in the deaths of 6 to 10 million people. Stalin imposed collective agriculture, prohibiting people from cultivating on their own, and imprisoning dissenters in Siberian labour camps. In Russia and Ukraine, millions went hungry, and hundreds of thousands died in prison camps. When Ukrainian production fell short of Stalin’s quota, he punished them even more by taking away everything they had. In Ukraine, Stalin’s forced famine is termed ‘Holodomor’ by joining the words for hunger (holod) and mor (extermination or mass-murder).Stalin’s atrocities were not restricted to the Soviet famine; he also carried out the ‘Great Purge,’ in which everyone he disapproved of was imprisoned, tortured, or executed. No one was spared, even wealthy peasants, politicians, military men, and ethnic minorities. The Purge alone is thought to have killed over 1.2 million people.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

Interestingly some of the others who also helped him have now switched to the BJP,"" Sardesai had claimed.Days after the Income Tax (IT) Department recovered a whopping ₹353 crore from the offices of Dhiraj Prasad Sahu, ‘journalist’ Rajdeep Sardesai came to the rescue of the Congress MP.In a video posted on his YouTube channel on Friday (16th December), Sardesai claimed that the scam-tainted politician had no chance of being a Parliamentarian. While citing a make-believe ‘source’, he alleged that the Congress wanted to deny Sahu a ticket to the Rajya Sabha in 2018. The controversial ‘journalist’ claimed that the party relented after leaders, who have now defected to the BJP, lobbied for him. He also made reference to a ‘dead’ Congress leader who supposedly influenced the decision of the party to send Dhiraj Prasad Sahu to the Rajya Sabha.At a time when the grand-old-party is under scanner over allegations of corruption, Rajdeep Sardesai was seen making a last-ditch effort to give a clean chit to the Congress’ high command.“A senior Congress leader from Jharkhand claims Sahu was to be denied a ticket in 2018 but he reportedly managed to get his Rajya Sabha nomination at the very last moment with the help of a very key people in the Congress hierarchy in the National Capital,” he was heard saying.“Among his key benefactors is someone who is no longer alive and held the purse strings of the Congress for a very long time. Interestingly some of the others who also helped him have now switched to the BJP,” Sardesai brazened out.Dhiraj Prasad Sahu is a Rajya Sabha MP for Congress from Jharkhand. His family has been associated with the Congress party since independence. He became RS MP in by-polls in 2009 for the first time. In 2010, he was elected as RS MP for the second time; in 2018, he was re-elected for RS by Congress for the third time. He actively participates in parliamentary proceedings. Sahu was part of Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Yatra. In recent raids at Odisha-based Boudh Distillery Pvt Ltd, where Dhiraj Prasad Sahu is a partner, the Income Tax Department recovered ₹353 cr of unaccounted cash.

"14 December, 2023 ","News24 posts misleading tweet on Muslim sculptors making idol of Ram Lalla, here are the facts on the idols being made for the Ram...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/news24-posts-misleading-tweet-on-muslim-sculptors-making-idol-of-ram-lalla/,"While Muslim sculptor Jamaluddin and his son are making fibre statues of Lord Ram for decorative purposes, News24 claimed they are making Ram Lalla idol to be placed in Ram MandirAs the date for grand opening of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya approaches, various updates about the temple are being reported by the media. However, misleading and fake news are also being published by some media houses regarding the Ram Mandir. One such false information was provided by News24, which claimed that the idol of Ram Lalla to be installed in the temple is being made by a Muslim sculptor and his son.On 14th December, News24 posted a tweet on X, claiming that Muhammad Jamaluddin from West Bengal and his son Bittu are sculpting the idol of Ram Lalla, which will take its place in the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. The tweet in Hindi said, “Ramlalla is ready to sit in the Ram temple of Ayodhya in January.” After that, the media houses added four bullet points, the first of which said, “The idols were made by Mohammad Jamaluddin of Bengal and his son Bittu.”News24 then said in the post that father-son duo has been crafting idols for a long time. The post then added remarks by Jamaluddin, who said, ‘Religion is a personal thing. People following many religions live in our country. The culture of brotherhood is my message as an artiste.’By saying that Jamaluddin and his son are making the idol of Ram Lall to be placed in Ram Mandir, News24 implied that the Muslim duo is making the main idol to placed in the sanctum sanctorum of the temple. But this is completely fake and misleading claim, and no Muslim is making the main idol of Ram Lalla.In fact, other media reports on Jamaluddin make it clear that he is making a decorating idol using fibre for the opening ceremony of Ram Mandir. As per a report by India Today, Mohammed Jamaluddin and his son Bittu have been engaged in creating some statues that will adorn the temple complex. The report stated that he is making life-size fibre statues.Other reports make it clear that the fibre statutes of Lord Ram and other Gods will be used to decorate the temple complex and the Ayodhya City during the inauguration ceremony. TV9 reported that statues of Lord Ram will be placed in major intersections in Ayodhya, and some of these idols are being made by Jamaluddin and his son.After several social media users pointed out the misleading claim made by News24, the media house later deleted the tweet.Fibre idols are generally used for decorative purposes, and they are not used as the main deity in temples. Most deities in Hindu temples are made from various types of stones, while temporary idols made for annual festivals are made using clay. Fibre idols last longer than clay, but are much easier to make compared to carving stone. Fibre idols are generally made for export, as they are lighter and easy to transport with the risk of damage. Notably, not one but three idols of Ram Lalla are being made in Ayodhya by three separate artists, and one of them will be picked by a committee to be placed in Sanctum Santorum, after which the pran pratistha rituals will be conducted by priests. Champat Rai, general secretary of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Trust, had earlier informed that the three different idols are being made by three sculptors – Ganesh Bhatt and Arun Yogiraj from Karnataka and Satyanarayan Pandey from Jaipur. Two of the idols are being made using two stones from Karnataka and one from Rajasthan. Earlier, a stone was brought from Nepal, and later stones were also brought from Odisha and Maharashtra to carve the idol, but those were found not suitable.Ganesh Bhatt of Karnataka is carving out the idol from Nellikaru rock or black stones which is also known as Shyam shila or Krishna shila. Famous sculptor Arun Yogiraj of Mysore, who sculpted the 12-ft statue of Adi Shankaracharya unveiled by PM Modi in Kedarnath, is sculpting another idol using another rock from Karnataka. Satya Narayan Pandey of Rajasthan is carving the Ram Lalla idol from white Makrana marble stones. All three artists are chiselling the idols based on a sketch by renowned artist Vasudeo Kamath from Mumbai.The 51-inch-tall Ram Lalla depicts the child form of Lord Ram, same as the current smaller idol that was placed in the makeshift temple for over half a century. The idol will depict five-year-old Ram Lalla sitting on a lotus, carrying a bow in one hand and an arrow in the other. Many other symbols related to Lord Ram will carved on the statue.While one idol will be selected to be permanently placed in the sanctum sanctorum, the other two idols will be placed in prominent places inside the temple premises.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"14 December, 2023 ","N Ram pats his own back for a pompous, gassy editorial in The Hindu, The Wire has a monumental meltdown: Fallout of SC decision...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/n-ram-pompous-editorial-the-hindu-the-wire-meltdown-sc-decision-article-370/,"N.Ram, Siddarth Varadarajan and their ilk know very well that the Parliament can split or not split a state even when there is an elected government in place and the legislature wishes otherwise.On December 11th, the Supreme Court upheld the abolition of the dreaded Article 370 (I know it was repealed and therefore while Article 370 still exists in the Constitution, the original dreaded purpose for which it was intended doesn’t exist anymore). Certain sections of the English media; certain sections of the I.N.D.I alliance and the entire Congress party went bonkers over this decision of the Supreme Court. Watching their meltdowns gave me goosebumps, literally. Am sure that their WhatsApp groups buzzed with messages on what should be their best strategy on this topic. The line of argument they have chosen to bombard their readers/viewers is – Attack on Federalism! A long, pompous and gassy editorial was published in his newspaper, The Hindu (we will get it later in this article). N. Ram showed utmost humility and described his editorial as “clear-sighted and insightful”. A former CEO of The Hindu group of publications, Rajiv C. Lochan, dared to call out this humility of N.Ram on Twitter here (“Beware when one pats one’s own back”. He went on to comment that “the pervasive use of adjectives can’t strengthen a relatively weak set of arguments”. Rajiv Lochan was telling N. Ram that just because he used good English doesn’t mean that this editorial is insightful. Now, the unparalleled arrogance of N. Ram is well known. Occasionally he takes it upon himself to prove it yet again to all his readers. Rajiv Lochan provided the best opportunity for N. Ram to exhibit his famed arrogance and intolerance in public. True to his image, N. Ram use a lot of English words to convey a simple meaning. I would urge you to read the image below and have a hearty laugh at N. Ram’s meltdown! He is telling Rajiv Lochan that a mere CEO should shut up because there is no one better than N.Ram to have opinions in this whole world. How can a mere CEO comment in public about matters as trivial as Article 370? Imagine N. Ram’s attitude towards mere citizens if he goes bombastic like this on his former CEO! After reading the “clear-sighted and insightful” editorial about 3 to 5 times, I was able to find 2 sentences that summarized the arguments of the entire English media gang. The title of the editorial makes it sound like doomsday is near and we will die because of what the Supreme Court did! I have highlighted the relevant portion in the editorial that tells us that Parliament can now do anything while keeping a state under the President’s rule. This was what his compatriots at The Wire were also shrieking about. The meltdown at The Wire was even more monumental in proportions. Multiple opinion pieces popped up in a short time – all telling us the same thing – that there is no difference left between “democracy and dictatorship”; that there are “Serious implications” for the entire country; that this is an “attack on the basic structure of federalism”; and the best of all – Many “locals had feared” that they have been pushed into “meaningful silence”!Think about what these people are writing folks. What is wrong with “meaningful silence”? What is wrong with anything that is classified as “meaningful”? How can you use the word “meaningful” as a consequence of having “fear” to want it? N.Ram, Siddarth Varadarajan and their ilk know very well that the Parliament can split or not split a state even when there is an elected government in place and the legislature wishes otherwise. When she was the CM of UP, Mayawati passed a resolution in the UP Assembly asking the centre to split into 4 states. The then Home Minister flatly rejected the resolution. The disastrous manner in which AP was split into TS and AP is still fresh in many minds. The AP Legislature resolved that the state should not be split. Did that stop Sonia Gandhi from taking a stand otherwise? Examples galore exist on this topic. Starting from 1956 when their hero Nehru suspended the first elected communist government in the world in Kerala using a “brute majority” in Parliament. We can further discuss the language of Articles 1,2 and 3 in the Constitution of India. It wouldn’t serve any purpose for these people. We are approaching 10 years of Modi government. Despite their wonderful knowledge of the English language, these editors and owners have not been able to find new words, in the past 10 years, to describe their contempt towards the people of India for electing Modi. By rehashing the same words, and in the garb of being “insightful” and “clear-sighted”, all that these people have succeeded in was to show us how blinded they are to the reality of a new emerging Bharat. A Bharat that will embrace all meaningful decisions and leave behind all the meaningless trash these people dish out every day. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"18 December, 2023 ","After banning animal sacrifice at Shyama Mai Temple, the next target may be Maa Kali’s narmund mala: How this Sanatana tradition differs from Bakrid",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/animal-sacrifice-at-shyama-mai-temple-how-this-sanatana-tradition-differs-from-bakrid/,"The devotees have questioned the intentions of the state government as the ban on Pashubali is being seen as tying the hands of the devotees who have faith in Shyama Mai and have been sacrificing animals for generations.The Bihar government has announced a ban on the practice of Pashubali (animal sacrifice) in the Shyama Mai Temple of Darbanga. The decision of the Bihar Government has angered the Hindu devotees. The Bihar State Religious Trust Council, chaired by Akhilesh Kumar Jain, imposed the ban. Jain was previously Law Secretary. Hindus have started agitation against the decision, demanding his resignation. They also burnt his effigy. Devotees are saying that Hindu traditions are being played with. They questioned why the state government is interfering in the practice that has been going on since ancient times in the temple.Currently, the Bihar government is being run by the alliance of JDU, RJD and Congress headed by Nitish Kumar. Tejashwi Yadav is the deputy CM of the state. Following the state government’s decision, several Hindu organizations, including Bajrang Dal, have imposed the decision. Notably, all parties ruling the state government oppose the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). While the BJP is vocal on Hindutva issues, the state government’s decision is being seen as against Hindu tradition. The devotees have questioned the intentions of the state government as the ban on Pashubali is being seen as tying the hands of the devotees who have faith in Shyama Mai and have been sacrificing animals for generations.Notably, the Shyama Mai Temple is on the funeral pyre of Maharaj Rameshwar Singh of Darbhanga. Raja Rameshwar Singh was a devotee of Kali Maa and practised Tantra Sidhi. This is why the temple is also called Rameshwari Mai Temple. The temple was constructed in 1933 by his son Kameshwar Singh. Talking about the temple’s sanctum sanctorum, Mahakal is installed on the right side of the idol of Maa Kali and Ganapati and Batukbhairav are installed on the left side.The Mundamala around the neck of Maa Kali has the same number of Narmunds as the number of letters in the Hindi alphabet. The Hindi alphabet is also considered a symbol of creation. Special events are being organized here during Navratri. Devi Maa is worshipped here in both Vedic and Tantric processes. In ‘Rameshwar Charit Mithila Ramayana’, Laldas, the servant of Maharaj, also describes Shyama Mai as the form of Mata Sita. In this story, Lord Ram was hit by an arrow from the demon Sahastranand, after which the angry Mata Sita’s complexion turned black, and her tongue came out.This form of her was called Shyama Mai. It is said that Lord Shiva himself had to come to calm his anger. There are two things worth noting here – first, it is a Shakta temple, a place of goddess worship. Secondly, Tantra Sadhana has also been taking place in the temple since the beginning. Both of these are part of the Sanatan Hindu tradition. Animal sacrifices are made in Tantra Sadhna practices.Bihar State Religious Trust Council has banned the practice of sacrifice, citing the Cruelty to Animals Act. The protesters have decided that hundreds of people will gather and sacrifice animals in the temple premises as a mark of non-cooperation with this order of the state government.This is not the first time a government has banned Pashubali. In October-November 2020, an FIR was registered against those who sacrificed animals in the Durga temple of Kamathi in Nagpur, Maharashtra. In Kerala, animal sacrifice was banned by making a law.Speaking to OpIndia, Mohit Bhardwaj, founder of ‘Vedic India’ and an expert on Hindu traditions, said that animal sacrifice is allowed in the Hindu religion but with many rules and restrictions. He said that in the Hindu religion, many communities offer animals as food to the deity. He gave the example of Shrauta and Grihya Sutras, in which animal sacrifice is permitted. Suchitra Samanta said in a research paper published in the ‘Association for Asian Studies’ that animal sacrifice is allowed in many Tantras and Puranas.In the Hindu religion, there are provisions for offering meat and vegetables as food to the Gods and Goddesses. Animal sacrifice has special importance in Goddess worship. For example, meat is also offered as Prasad to the Goddess in Bengal during Navratri. Animal sacrifice is common there, as it is part of the Shakta tradition. Since ancient times, animal sacrifice has been done in the worship of Shakti and Tantra Sadhana.Notably, the forest dweller community, which is part of Hinduism, offers meat as Prasad to the Gods and Goddesses as part of their daily routine. However, the “secular” law of India has stopped it. On the other hand, if someone kills an animal to eat meat, it is justified. It is evident that the religious traditions of only one community are being disrespected and stopped.If the government wants to ban animal sacrifice, they should not allow such practices on Bakrid as well, where rivers of blood flow. Not to forget, Muslims follow the ‘Halal’ way of killing animals, where they are tortured and killed slowly. Interestingly, no one sees animal cruelty in that practice. Since there is unity in Muslim society, the political parties have to follow the path of appeasement, and they often avoid meddling with their traditions.However, when it comes to Hindus, the governments become the contractors of the religion. It is a fact that the Islamic way of killing animals is barbaric. However, it should be the basis for the government or courts’ decisions regarding Hindu traditions. Hindu society needs to wake up and pay attention to preserve its traditions. The government has no right to ban animal sacrifice.दरभंगा श्यामा माई मंदिर में बलि प्रदान पर रोक से लोगों में आक्रोश। pic.twitter.com/KV7GjBmyPyThe Supreme Court had allowed women to worship at the Sabarimala Temple in Kerala based on a petition filed by activists with no faith in Hinduism. Misinformation was spread about the temple, and it was anti-women. Girls and elderly women are allowed to worship in Sabarimala Temple. On the other hand, the government or judiciary do not decide who will enter a mosque and who will not.The Hindu religion will operate as decided by the traditions of the temples, scriptures, history, and opinions of the Hindu scholars, not by the government or the court. Sanatan Dharma has seen several changes since it came into existence. Some practices were added, and some were removed, but society did them. At that time, courts and governments did not exist in their present form. After a few days, the government may come and say that Maa Kali should not wear Narmund and it should be removed as it promotes violence. Will Hindus accept it?Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources. We need your support to fight them.

But I am not able to mute you.” On returning from the short break, Vivek Ramaswamy realised that his mic was unmuted and understood what had transpired. He immediately apologised for the embarrassing moment. However, on a lighter note, Musk quips, “I hope you feel better now”. To which Ramaswamy replied, “I feel great.

It was enlarged in 2021 to about 5 lakh square feet. This has allowed a capacity of 50,000 - 75,000 devotees in the temple premises.The Shri Kashi Vishwanath Dham in Varanasi has become one of the top pilgrimage spots in India as a record 12.92 crore devotees visited the holy shrine in two years. Notably, the expanded Kashi Vishwanath Dham will soon complete its two years on 13th December. Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Kashi Vishwanath Dham corridor on 13th December 2021, and since then, the number of devotees of Mahadev has increased manifold. The official added that the number is soon expected to breach the 13 crore mark. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the temple trust, Sunil Kumar Verma said, “Shri Kashi Vishwanath Dham was inaugurated on 13 December 2021. From then till 6 December 2023, more than 12 crore, 92 lakh and 24 thousand devotees have taken darshan of Baba.

"8 December, 2023 ",High priest to lead the consecration ceremony of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya is a descendant of priest who presided over the coronation of Chhatrapati...,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/know-the-shivaji-connection-of-priest-who-will-lead-ram-temple-consecration/,"More than 40 scholars from Kashi and 121 from all branches of the Vedas throughout India are scheduled to be guided by him during the solemn idol consecration ceremonies from January 16 to January 22. 86-year-old Vedic scholar Laxmikant Mathuranath Dixit is expected to preside over the consecration ritual of the Ram Lalla idol at the Ram temple in Ayodhya on 22 January, marking a landmark confluence of heritage and modern relevance. He is a Varanasi native and reportedly descended from the distinguished Kashi scholar Gaga Bhatt of the 17th century who headed the coronation of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj around 350 years ago in 1674, which was a momentous occasion in Indian history that represented the creation of Hindavi Swarajya, an autonomous Maratha state.More than 40 scholars from Kashi and 121 from all branches of the Vedas throughout India are scheduled to be guided by him during the solemn idol consecration ceremonies from January 16 to January 22. The learned man responded, “It is because of the blessings bestowed on me by the legendary saints and seers of Kashi that I have been assigned the responsibility of supervising the consecration of Ram Lalla. I will perform my duties with the blessings of Lord Ram,” in an interview.The scholar’s son, Sunil Laxmikant Dixit stated that his father’s areas of expertise included yajna, consecration, Srauta which is a Sanskrit word rooted in Sruti or that which is heard and Smarta which is based on Smriti, a particular collection of Hindu literature among other rites and rituals. “My father’s study of the Vedas and rituals was under the supervision of his uncle Ganesh Dixit Javji Bhatt. He completed his studies in Shukla Yajurveda at Sangved Vidyalaya and took up teaching in the same institution. Mathuranath Dixit proclaimed, “Our roots are in Jeur village near Solapur in Maharashtra. Our ancestors moved to Kashi and dedicated their lives to the study of Hindu traditions and rituals.” Laxmikant Mathuranath Dixit and other priests are conducting a series of religious ceremonies as part of the meticulous preparation of the consecration procedures which are scheduled to begin on 16 January. These customs which culminate on 22 January when Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to carry out the rites commemorating the consecration of the Ram Lalla idol include Sarva Prayashchit homam, Dashvid Snan, Jalyatra, Tirth and Kalash Pujan as well as Kalash Yatra.Three idols of Ram Lalla are being made in Ayodhya, and the religious committee of the temple trust is tasked with picking the finest among them. The idols of Lord Ram are believed to be almost finished and are 90% concluded. The idols depict the diety’s child form. One idol is made with stone from Rajasthan and two are made from stones brought from Karnataka, the finishing touches will require around a week. Earlier, a stone was brought from Nepal, and later stones were also brought from Odisha and Maharashtra to carve the idol, but those were found not suitable. The sanctum sanctorum and the temple’s ground floor are already in a highly developed state of preparedness. Among the several ceremonies leading up to the consecration, one of the main ones on 21 January is the immersion of the idol of Ram Lalla in water from sacred rivers and well-known Hindu pilgrimage destinations which is collected in 114 urns. On 22 January in the afternoon, there will be Devpranpratishtha (consecration) rites. The idol will be brought from 8 a.m. to noon to the sanctum sanctorum. Pran-Pratishtha of Ram Lalla will be observed on 16 January and the principal rituals will be performed on 22 January by Lakshmikant Dixit.After visiting the Vice President of Vishva Hindu Parishad Champat Rai in September, the Kanchi Kamakoti Shankaracharya despatched a team of scholars, including Laxmikant Mathuranath Dixit and Acharya Ganesh Shastri Dravid to Ayodhya to determine the dates of consecration.Notable individuals who have been invited to the consecration ceremony of the Ram temple include actors Arun Govil and Dipika Chikhlia who played Lord Ram and Goddess Sita in the hit TV series ‘Ramayana,’ industrialists Mukesh Ambani, Gautam Adani and Ratan Tata, cricketers Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli, Bollywood megastar Amitabh Bachchan among other actors.Over 7,000 guests comprising 3,000 VIPs have received invites from the Ram Mandir Trust. There will also be an invitation sent to the families of the karsevaks who lost their lives in the temple movement. Further invitees consist of 4,000 seers, writers, journalists, scientists, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) president Mohan Bhagwat, yoga guru Ramdev and esteemed figures from all around the nation.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"18 December, 2023 ",‘Hamid Ansari used to help gangster Mukhtar Ansari despite being the Vice President’: BJP MLA Sushil Singh,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/hamid-ansari-used-to-help-gangster-mukhtar-despite-being-vice-president-bjp-mla-sushil-singh/,"Sushil Singh further added that Mukhtar Ansari, along with his political patrons like SP and Congress, not only got his opponents murdered, but also used to break them mentally by filing many cases against them. On 15th December (Friday), a Varanasi MP/MLA court sentenced mafia-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari to five and a half years in prison for threatening a witness in the kidnapping of the Vishva Hindu Parishad treasurer. The court also imposed a fine of Rs 10,000 on Ansari for threatening Mahavir Prasad Rungta, the brother of coal businessman and VHP treasurer Nand Kishore Rungta, who was kidnapped by Ansari’s henchman from his Varanasi office on 22nd January 1997. This was the jailed mafia’s seventh conviction since September last year. Ansari, who appeared through video conferencing, was visibly upset after hearing the ruling. Reportedly he began pleading with the judge. When Judge Ujjwal Upadhyay started pronouncing the sentence, Ansari sat with his head down and his hands on his forehead. Following this, he pleaded before the judge, saying, ‘Judge Sahab, please have mercy so that all my sentences proceed simultaneously.’ However, in the decision given by the court, it was already mentioned. Notably, Nand Kishore Rungta, a coal businessman from Jawahar Nagar of Bhelupur police station area of Varanasi, was murdered after being kidnapped on 22nd January 1997. Reports say that Nand Kishore was killed even after the family paid a ransom of Rs 1.25 crore to the kidnapper. After this, on the evening of 5th November 1997, Nand Kishore Rungta’s brother Mahavir Prasad Rungta, a witness in the case, and his family received bomb threats on his landline not to file a complaint with the police.However, the victim’s family lodged an FIR in the Bhelupur police station of Varanasi in which the court pronounced its verdict. Strikingly, in May this year, the OpIndia team visited several districts in Purvanchal that faced the severe brunt of violence at the hands of Ansari and his henchman. During the visit, OpIndia spoke with BJP MLA Sushil Singh who made several shocking claims and called Mukhtar a traitor.It is important to note that different courts have served Mukhtar Ansari with punishment ranging from 2 years to life imprisonment in different cases. At present, hearings are underway in courts for 21 out of the 65 cases registered against him. He is currently lodged in Banda jail and is being kept under strict surveillance.In May, the OpIndia team had visited various districts of Purvanchal including Varanasi, Mau, Ghazipur, and Chandauli. These districts were once badly affected by the crimes of Mukhtar Ansari. During this Purvanchal tour, the OpIndia team met Sushil Singh, BJP MLA from Chandauli’s Saidaraja Assembly.Speaking with OpIndia, BJP MLA Sushil Singh had said that Mukhtar Ansari is not only a criminal but also a traitor. He asserted that Mukhtar Ansari not only committed various crimes but also committed offenses like stealing the army’s LMG (Light Machine Gun). Notably, Ansari reportedly bought the army’s LMG (Light Machine Gun) from an Army deserter in 2004 to penetrate Krishnanand Rai’s bullet-proof SUV.BJP MLA Sushil further told OpIndia that Mukhtar and his family have been involved in crime along with politics. He said that Mukhtar continued committing crimes because no one in his family suffered untimely death as a cost of his criminal enterprise, haece he doesn’t know how it feels to pay the price of violence. BJP MLA Sushil Singh told OpIndia that Mukhtar Ansari got at least 100 of his political opponents killed. It is alleged that these murders continued unabated under the patronage of the Samajwadi Party government. According to Sushil Singh, Mukhtar Ansari primarily targeted Hindus, orchestrating plans in which Hindus killed Hindus.BJP MLA Sushil Singh added that while the Samajwadi Party shielded and advocated the crimes of Mukhtar Ansari from Lucknow, the Congress did the same and protected him from Delhi. According to Sushil Singh, the Congress Party had imposed MCOCA on Mukhtar’s entire family at the latter’s instructions.Naming the then Vice President Hamid Ansari, the BJP MLA Singh alleged that Hamid Ansari used to lobby for Mukhtar by dialing the police station. Additionally, Hamid Ansari also missed his powers to register cases at the police station against those who stood against Mukhtar.Sushil Singh further added that Mukhtar Ansari, along with his political patrons like SP and Congress, not only got his opponents murdered, but also used to break them mentally by filing many cases against them. Sushil Singh noted that even in this bad time, he got the support of Narendra Modi and Yogi Adityanath, based on which he continued his struggle against Mukhtar Ansari.Speaking with OpIndia, BJP MLA Sushil Singh became emotional. He said that his innocent uncle Satish Singh, a farmer, was also murdered by Mukhtar Ansari. According to Sushil Singh, the murder was carried out to instill fear in the minds of people. He added that the murder of Krishnanand Rai was also done by Mukhtar Ansari to create terror.Recalling the year 2004, Sushil Singh mentioned that during Manoj Sinha’s Lok Sabha election campaign in Ghazipur, he had visited the area for campaigning. He claimed that the police had surrounded him intending to harm him. After leaving, several BJP workers were apprehended, held in the police station, and subjected to torture. According to him, he survived because of God’s grace. Sushil Singh also recalled the 2009 elections when there was a contest in the Lok Sabha elections in Varanasi between BJP’s Murli Manohar Joshi and Mukhtar Ansari. At that time, Sushil Singh was an MLA from the Bahujan Samaj Party.He alleges that, at Mukhtar Ansari’s behest, Mayawati imposed numerous cases on him overnight. According to him, this was done so that Sushil Singh could be murdered in the future. He admitted that at that time he was opposing Mukhtar Ansari and supporting Murli Manohar Joshi for Hindutva.BJP MLA Sushil Singh had claimed that even though the mafia don Mukhtar Ansari has become weak due to the change of government, the roots of his crime empire are still spread across UP. Sushil Singh admitted that many victims are still hesitant to come out due to fear of Mukhtar.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"15 December, 2023 ","Who is Shahrukh Pathan’s father: Convicted for 10 years over drug peddling, evidence of collusion with Pakistanis and more",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/who-is-shahrukh-pathan-father-convicted-10-years-drug-peddling-collusion-pakistani-delhi-riots/,"The bail order made several revelations about Shahrukh Patha, the case and the remorseless conduct of Pathan after he was arrested, based on the evidence provided by the prosecution which were accepted by the court. Shahrukh Pathan, who pointed a gun at a policeman during the anti-Hindu riots in North-East Delhi in 2020, was refused regular bail by a Delhi court on 14th December. The court stated it observed no need to grant him bail and Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat of Karkardooma Court noted, “Considering the conduct of the accused Shahrukh Pathan in jail during his judicial custody, his conduct prior to his being arrested, conduct during court proceedings and most importantly, the allegations against the accused which are being supported by the eyewitnesses and also the video footage, on any of the counts on which bail can be considered, the court sees nothing to set him enlarged on bail.”The bail order made several revelations about Shahrukh Patha,n the case and the remorseless conduct of Pathan after he was arrested, based on the evidence provided by the prosecution which was accepted by the court. The case pertains to the infamous picture where Shahrukh Pathan was seen holding a gun to a police officer’s head during the Delhi anti-hindu riots. During the riot, on the 24th of February 2020, a confrontation broke out between Jaffrabad Metro Station and Maujpur Bridge. There were more than 5,000 people who came face to face in that area. The anti-CAA protestors (Islamist mob) were pelting stones and brandishing guns. When the investigation was carried out, 3 cartridges were found at the spot where Shahrukh Pathan brandished a gun, aimed at the head of a police officer in uniform. The order details how Shahrukh Pathan first fired a few rounds at the crowd and refused to pay heed to the warnings issued by the police officer. When he advanced, for the safety of the crowd, the police officer stood in his path and did not move. When Pathan was at a distance of 9-10 feet from the police officer, he fired his weapon aimed at the police officer’s head to kill him. The police officer dodged the bullet but continued to stand there in his path so he couldn’t advance further and kill the Hindus. As the police officer refused to move, Pathan pushed the officer and then aimed the gun at his head again. When the police officer issued another warning after being pushed, Shahrukh Pathan fired at the crowd and started retreating. It was only after sustained interrogation that Shahrukh Pathan revealed his full identity and confessed to his involvement in the crime. The prosecution has also argued that Shahrukh Pathan was not only attempting to kill the police officer but was also leading the mob. Interestingly, the order reveals how Shahrukh Pathan was not cooperative during the investigation and refused to reveal the identity of other rioters who were involved. During the investigation, it is detailed, that Pathan also tried his best to mislead the police. He has also displayed aggressive and remorseless conduct in jail. The prosecution argued that if let out on bail, he could potentially influence witnesses and tamper with evidence. Also, given the fear of the 10-year jail term that could be handed to him, he could abscond. Taking into account his conduct inside the jail and during the investigation, the court agreed with the prosecution and refused to grant him bail. In the order document detailing the arguments of the prosecution, there was one specific argument that deserved further investigation. The prosecution had argued that Shahrukh Pathan’s father, Sabir Ali (alias Baldev Singh) was convicted for 10 years with a fine of Rs 1 lac under Section 14 of the Foreigners Act and sections of the NDPS Act. OpIndia pulled up the court judgement in the case where Shahrukh Pathan’s father was convicted by a Delhi court. The judgement convicting him was pronounced on 11th August 2016. The facts of the case, detailed in the court order, almost read like a movie. In January 2010, Meghalaya Police filed a complaint in Delhi that three Pakistani nationals Abdul Razzaq, Mohd. Saddique and Rafakat Ali who had been brought from Lampur Seva Sadan (FRRO detention centre) on 1st January 2010 to Guru Nanak Eye Hospital for their medical examination had escaped while they were being taken back. During the investigation to track down the missing Pakistanis, the visitor’s register which was maintained by Meghalaya Police was also checked. The entries in the register made from 28/9/2009 to 02/01/2010 revealed that two people – Anees Khan and Arbaz Khan – had met Abdul Razzaq and Saleem on 29/12/2009 and 30/12/2009. During interrogation, it was revealed that before absconding on 1/1/2010, the three Pakistanis had after going to Gurunanak Eye Hospital were first taken to Jama Masjid and then one of them (Abdul Razzak) was taken by him to Seelampur near Jaffarbad to collect money from someone. Anees and Arbaz were nephews of Sabir Ali. It is pertinent to understand here that the three Pakistanis were in India illegally and therefore, were being held at a detention centre. From the story so far, it is also clear that they were given harbour at Jama Masjid from where one of them was taken to Seelampur (near Jaffrabad) to collect money – the very area where the Delhi anti-Hindu riots had broken out in February 2020 – in which Shahrukh Pathan was also leading a mob. Based on this investigation, Sabir Ali (Baldev Singh), Anees Khan and Arbaz were called to the Special Cell office and inquiries were made from them. During interrogation, it was revealed that it was Sabir Ali (Baldev Singh) who had given money to Abdul Razzaq at Seelampur before he had absconded. Essentially, from the records so far, it is clear that it was Shahrukh Pathan’s father who had give money to a Pakistani before they had absconded. This money was give to the illegal in Seelampur. The numbers that were taken from the accused during interrogation were then thoroughly investigated after those detained and questioned – including the father of Shahrukh Pathan – were set free. During the surveillance of the numbers, it was revealed that the accused – including Pathan’s father – were involved in the business of fake currency and drugs. There was also an intercepted call where Sabir Ali had spoken about the international smuggling of drugs. After this surveillance, when a notice was served to Sabir Ali, Arbaz and Anees, they refused to answer the notice served by the special cell. The Special Cell then received information about a Charas and Smack delivery that Sabir Ali and his co-accused Sannaullah Mir were about to make. When the raiding party intercepted Ali and Mir, they discovered drugs in their possession. Substantial amounts of drugs were also found on the scooter of Sabir Ali – the substance in the scooter was heroin. After the subsequent arrest, Mir and Ali were interrogated separately. During interrogation, the father of Shahrukh Pathan, Sabir Ali, confessed that he was in the business of drugs and fake currency notes along with his associates Anees, Arbaz, Jarnail and Mir. He also disclosed how the police could arrest Jarnail Singh and revealed that on an earlier occasion, Singh had given him 2 lacs and drugs, parts of which were then distributed to the others. He also agreed to lead the police to another accused – Javed. Several of the co-accused were then arrested post-interrogation of Ali. In 2011, all the accused persons were charged for the offences u/s 29 r.w.s. 21, 20 and 23 of the NDPS Act and accused Sabir Ali was separately charged for the offence u/s 21(c), 25A of the NDPS Act and accused Sanaullah Mir was separately charged for the offence of u/s 20 (b) (ii) (C) of the NDPS Act. All the accused persons were also charged for the offences u/s 489 C r.w.s. 120B IPC.In court, the prosecution examined 39 witnesses in all to prove its case against the accused. All the accused, including the father of Shahrukh Pathan, took the defence that they had been falsely implicated by the police and that no contraband/counterfeit currency notes had been recovered from their possession or at their instance at any point in time. Among all the accused, the court ‘particularly’ was intrigued by the defence of Sabir Ali alias Baldev Singh. It is pertinent to mention here that Shahrukh Pathan’s father was previously a Sikh named Baldev Singh and had converted to Islam before marrying. When Sabir Ali started explaining why he was supposedly implicated by the police, he ended up revealing his long illustrious career as a criminal. Here is what the court document said: “In particular accused Baldev Singh has stated that he originally belongs to Punjab and shifted to Delhi in 1984 due to political turmoil and terrorist activities in Punjab. In Delhi he started selling garments from a patri in Chandni Chowk but in the year 1984 the police officials of Maurice Nagar falsely arrested him on a mere suspicion that he was a terrorist. When their enquiry into his antecedents did not reveal anything incriminating against him, they planted contraband on him and falsely implicated him in a case under the Excise Act. After spending three years in the jail in the said case, he came out and started working as a driver for a transport company. During the said services a vehicle which he was driving was intercepted by DRI and contraband was recovered from the same. Though he had no knowledge and had nothing to do with the contraband concealed in the said vehicle, he was arrested by DRI and also subsequently convicted in the said case and again spent more than 10 years in judicial custody. After coming out from the jail after undergoing the sentence in the said case he again started his life afresh and started doing the business of pannis/plastics and started living with his children, his wife, his brother in law, Anees and Arbaz, the son of his second brother in law Babu Khan, in his house H.No. U­108, Gali no. 5, Arvind Nagar, Gautam Vihar, Gonda. He suspects that somebody in his locality informed the local police officials about his previous records and that is why the officials of Special Cell came to his residence in the first week of January, 2010 and forcibly picked him, his son and Anees and Arbaz and took them to PS and started inquiring about same Pakistani nationals who had absconded. Though they were released from the PS after the police officials found nothing incriminating against them, on 3/9/2010 again he, Anees and Arbaz were forcibly picked up from their residence at 1:30 a.m. in the night and brought to the office of Special cell, Rohini and falsely implicated in this case”. Essentially, Shahrukh Pathan’s father at the time had asserted that he was being falsely implicated by the police in this case of collusion with Pakistanis and being involved in an international drug peddling and fake currency racket because he had done exactly that in the past, been convicted for it, and therefore, the police thought of him as a convenient target. Further, he also dared to claim that all the previous times he was caught with contrabands and convicted, even then, he was falsely implicated. The shoddy defence that was put up by Sabir Ali was backed only by one witness – the witness’ only testimony was that he had never seen a Pakistani enter the home of Ali. This statement was made without any evidence. The court said, “The testimony of the prosecution witnesses is trustworthy and believable and nothing has emerged in their cross­examination which cast doubt on the veracity of their statement or to impeach their creditworthiness”. The court also said that all the seizure of drugs and fake currency was done per the law. While the defence tried to puncture technical holes in the process, the court threw out all of their arguments and convicted the accused – including Sabir Ali. To that effect, the court said, “as far as recovery of contraband from accused Baldev Singh and Sanaullah is concerned, in my view, the prosecution has been able to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt”. While the court rejected the argument that the accused were colluding with each other, it convicted all accused for the possession of contraband substances, however, there was amply evidence of collusion as well based on the statements of Ali. Based on this evidence, Sabir Ali, the father of Shahrukh Pathan, was sentenced to 10 years in prison and 1 lac fine in 2016. According to reports, Shahrukh’s mother also is said to be a notorious drug peddler.In his show ‘Prime Time’ on 26th February 2020, Ravish Kumar resorted to spreading half-truths and full lies about the horrifying spate of violence that had engulfed the national capital. In pursuance of what appeared as his agenda to tarnish Hindus and portray them as the aggressors of the riots, Kumar identified Mohammad Shahrukh alias Shahrukh Pathan, who fired at Delhi Police personnel on February 24, as one ‘Anurag Mishra’. For the 26th February show, Ravish claimed that police had not yet arrested him while he was arrested on 25th February itself, good 24 hours before his show premiered. “Police ki haalat yeh hai ki abhi tak giraftar nahin hua hai. Police saaf kehti hai ki Shahrukh hai magar aap social media mein dekhiye Anurag Mishra bataya jaa raha hai. (Situation of the Police is such that they have not yet arrested him. Police says his name is Shahrukh but if you see on social media, he is called Anurag Mishra),” he spoke in his characteristic drawl during the show. Naturally, it was quite a revelation since no one had yet referred to the shooter as “Anurag Mishra” till then.He then asked Delhi Police to speak out on his identity again. He then played an undated speech of his reporter who appeared to be asking Delhi Police personnel about Shahrukh’s arrest. Slyly, Ravish Kumar then played the videos of BJP leaders Anurag Thakur, Kapil Mishra and Pravesh Verma addressing rallies ahead of Delhi elections to cast aspersions that their speeches were responsible for stoking riots a month later. Further, in August 2021, 18 months after the 25-year-old Delhi anti-Hindu riots accused Shahrukh Pathan was arrested for brandishing a gun at the police and threatening them, The Quint published a white paper on him watering down his crime and making him appear like a cherubic saint. The Quint started by describing his menacing march as ‘brazen confidence in his gait’. Then the writer of the ‘Shahrukh Pathan fan page’ romanticised his criminal act. “Unfazed by the policemen in riot gear, he shot bullets in the air while media persons captured his acts in astonishment. The fact that the gym enthusiast, who was also a local, did not wear a mask to hide his identity, made his ‘bravado’ seem peculiar and odd,” the author wrote. The Quint then went on to explain how his friends described Shahrukh as someone who was into grooming and was interested in his appearance. He was characterised as someone who was a biryani-lover, liked to put gel in his hair, blow dry it, wear crisp, ironed shirts, good shoes and well, make TikTok videos. The author interviewed Pathan’s mother, who had glowing views about her son. She said her son was innocent and ‘simple-minded’.Shahrukh’s mother also highlighted counterfactual scenarios to water down her son’s criminality. She told his fans at The Quint that she often wonders, “What if she had given him food when he asked? What if the timing was a few minutes before or after namaz?” Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

"15 December, 2023 ","‘They came in a vehicle with no number plates, set fire on Bittu Bajrangi’s brother’: Arman had earlier burned his own shop to blame...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/bittu-bajrangis-brother-set-on-fire-arman-had-earlier-burned-his-own-shop-to-blame-hindus-says-activist/,"Bittu Bajrangi said that during the Nuh riots, Armaan used to sell juice in Faridabad. He had set his own shop on fire and had tried to blame local Hindus for it. However, his lie was caught during the police investigation.On Wednesday (December 13th) Hindu activist Bittu Bajrangi’s family was targeted and attackers attempted to burn his brother Mahesh Panchal alive by pouring thinner on him in the Dabua Colony in Haryana’s Faridabad. Within hours, victim Mahesh Panchal was transferred from three hospitals while in a critical condition. Mahesh has sustained severe burn injuries, estimated to be around 60%, and he is in critical condition. The next 72 hours, according to the doctors, will be crucial for the victim.As per the information received, the assailants who burned Mahesh first attempted to capture and burn him, but they were unsuccessful. Subsequently, they poured thinner on Mahesh and set him ablaze. Following this, the accused escaped. Mahesh dived into a drain right away, but the fire was not extinguished. He then took 3-4 dips, and the fire was quenched. After that, he walked to his house, which was around 800 metres away on his own as nobody came forward to help him. When finally Mahesh somehow reached his home, Bittu Bajrangi took him the the hospital. According to media reports, the attackers led by one Armaan first confirmed Bittu Bajrangi’s brother Mahesh Panchal’s identity. ‘Are you the brother of Bittu Bajrangi?’ they questioned Mahesh Panchal. When Mahesh said yes to this question, they poured thinner on him and set him ablaze.Arman Khan, the main accused in this case, has been arrested by police and is being interrogated. Meanwhile, the police have examined the crime scene. According to the report, the white WagonR used by the attackers had no registration number. Moreover, two bikes had followed him suspiciously to the location.Meanwhile, Bittu Bajrangi stated that Mahesh has been moved around three hospitals so far. First, it was the government hospital, then it was Santosh Hospital, and now it is Prachi Hospital. The doctors have said that the next 72 hours will be critical. Several members of Hindu organisations and local BJP MLAs visited the hospital to inquire about Mahesh’s well-being.Bittu Bajrangi said that during the Nuh riots, Armaan used to sell juice in Faridabad. He had set his own shop on fire and had tried to blame local Hindus for it. However, his lie was caught during the police investigation.Bittu Bajrangi further stated that he had been receiving death threats for a long with those behind the threats asking him to “take his slippers back (Chappal lekar jao)”. The code ‘chappal’ was used by the perpetrators to remind Bajrangi about the slippers Hindus had left outside the temple when the Islamist mob attacked them during Nuh violence earlier this year.Bittu alleged that the attackers who attempted to kill his brother were all involved in the July 31 violence unleashed by Islamists in Haryana’s Nuh district. Bittu Bajrangi stated that the family sought an arms licence, but the administration refused. Not only that, but Bittu said, citing a police officer, that the person who issued the threats had also threatened a prominent Gurgaon businessman for ‘protection money’ adding that he is a seasoned criminal.Meanwhile, an OpIndia team arrived on the scene and found several police personnel stationed at the hospital. Several members of Hindu organisations also convened at the hospital. However, no one is permitted to meet with the victim. The police have imposed multiple sections in this case, including sections 147, 149, 307, and 326A. Arman, the accused, is being questioned by local police.Bittu Bajrangi told OpIndia that he is satisfied with the actions taken by the Faridabad Police in the matter so far. He has also urged people to refrain from engaging in any form of protest or unlawful activity.Bittu Bajrangi is a Hindu activist who raises his voice for the unity of Hindus. After the violence that erupted in Nuh in the Mewat region, his name gained more traction in the news. Subsequently, he was also arrested in a case of a clash with the police. At present, Bittu Bajrangi is out of jail on bail. In this case, all Hindu organisations supported him. Initially, the rumour spread rapidly that Bittu Bajrangi was associated with the Nuh violence, but the police made it clear that action was taken against Bittu Bajrangi not related to the Nuh violence, but in a different case of a clash with the police.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"18 December, 2023 ","Congress kickstarts ‘Donate for Desh’ campaign, forgets to register the domains for the campaign ",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/congress-kickstarts-donate-for-desh-campaign-forgets-to-register-the-domains-for-the-campaign/,"While Congress launched its crowdfunding campaign 'Donate for Desh' without registering a domain name for the same, BJP and OpIndia acquired domain names that redirected Congress recently announced its crowdfunding campaign ‘Donate for Desh’ to raise funds from the general public following reports of massive seizures of unaccounted cash from Congress leaders. Days after the announcement, Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge on 18th December launched the campaign in New Delhi. Incidentally, the links for the Congress crowdfunding campaign land the donors on BJP’s donation page. It has come to light that the funds and donations through the Congress party’s campaign are adding to the Bharatiya Janata Party’s coffers. As per reports, the grand old party kicked off the crowdfunding campaign without registering the related domain names. Reports add that the BJP secured the website domains after Congress failed to register the relevant domains for the donation websites promoted in its fundraising campaign.The links redirected the donors to BJP and OPIndia’s donation pages. Simply put, when a person opens the Donatefordesh.org website, the user is redirected to BJP’s donation page which seeks details like donors’ name, mobile number, and email ID.Congress launches #DonateForDesh campaign but fails to book important domain. BJP bought it & redirected it on their website Check out 👉 https://t.co/EzdIREg5YC pic.twitter.com/uiWRqOhU4qSimilarly Donatefordesh.com and Donatefordesh.in take the user to the OpIndia Support pages. 😭😂😂 pic.twitter.com/3gkO2fpSVBCongress launched #DonateForDesh campaign.But it failed to book important domain names.So,BJP bought https://t.co/F3NcbFxDZc 😛Now after the campaign,@RahulGandhi will blame Adani for the donations happened to BJP 😂 pic.twitter.com/TyQh5cbvnYFollowing the goof-up in crowdfunding, netizens have been taking a jibe at the Congress party calling it the grand old party’s moye-moye moment. Netizens have slammed Congress asking the grand old party if it didn’t have any domain for these websites why it kicked off the campaign prematurely. I have been dealing in domains and hosting since 2003. It has been over 20 years. I have never seen someone so irresponsible as @INCIndia, who started a nationwide campaign by the name ""#DonateForDesh"" but forgot to register TLDs, including .com and .org. Check the domains below…Several users called it a major failure of the IT department of Congress party. According to several Twitter users, the failure alludes to the callous or non-serious approach of the party for its own crowdfunding campaign as otherwise, it had enough time and resources to run basic errands.I mean by their own admission, idiots had 2 days to book at least the .org or .in domain name, but they didn't. Has Congress got ""Donate for Desh"" as a trademark? If their alliance called be called INDIA, we can ask money too for DonateForDesh https://t.co/eXPfnV1VNoPlease don’t blame Shrieking Jane for the fiasco of Congress’s ‘Donate for Desh’ fraud. She has to not only appear less intelligent than Rahul Gandhi but also prove it. 😂Let alone domains, the Congress didn’t even block SM accounts. Check out @donatefordesh, for instance.और…However, it’s not that Congress hasn’t received donations in the last few years. In 2021-22, the party received donations totaling ₹95 crore through electoral bonds. Additionally, in September 2023, the Congress announced that it possesses assets worth about ₹700 crores.Nonetheless, the Congress party will be collecting donations both online and offline. On December 28, 2023, the party is celebrating its 138th anniversary. In alignment with that, it has issued an appeal to its supporters to contribute in multiples of ₹138, while urging its district and state-level workers to donate ₹1380.The campaign has been initiated by its president, Mallikarjun Kharge, who has donated ₹1.38 lakh to the party. Congress will conduct this campaign online until December 28, 2023, following which its workers will go door-to-door to collect donations. However, the crowdfunding campaign has been marred with a major setback and failure for the party’s IT department as it lost the race for website domains to BJP and OpIndia. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"18 December, 2023 ",‘Hamid Ansari used to help gangster Mukhtar Ansari despite being the Vice President’: BJP MLA Sushil Singh,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/hamid-ansari-used-to-help-gangster-mukhtar-despite-being-vice-president-bjp-mla-sushil-singh/,"Sushil Singh further added that Mukhtar Ansari, along with his political patrons like SP and Congress, not only got his opponents murdered, but also used to break them mentally by filing many cases against them. On 15th December (Friday), a Varanasi MP/MLA court sentenced mafia-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari to five and a half years in prison for threatening a witness in the kidnapping of the Vishva Hindu Parishad treasurer. The court also imposed a fine of Rs 10,000 on Ansari for threatening Mahavir Prasad Rungta, the brother of coal businessman and VHP treasurer Nand Kishore Rungta, who was kidnapped by Ansari’s henchman from his Varanasi office on 22nd January 1997. This was the jailed mafia’s seventh conviction since September last year. Ansari, who appeared through video conferencing, was visibly upset after hearing the ruling. Reportedly he began pleading with the judge. When Judge Ujjwal Upadhyay started pronouncing the sentence, Ansari sat with his head down and his hands on his forehead. Following this, he pleaded before the judge, saying, ‘Judge Sahab, please have mercy so that all my sentences proceed simultaneously.’ However, in the decision given by the court, it was already mentioned. Notably, Nand Kishore Rungta, a coal businessman from Jawahar Nagar of Bhelupur police station area of Varanasi, was murdered after being kidnapped on 22nd January 1997. Reports say that Nand Kishore was killed even after the family paid a ransom of Rs 1.25 crore to the kidnapper. After this, on the evening of 5th November 1997, Nand Kishore Rungta’s brother Mahavir Prasad Rungta, a witness in the case, and his family received bomb threats on his landline not to file a complaint with the police.However, the victim’s family lodged an FIR in the Bhelupur police station of Varanasi in which the court pronounced its verdict. Strikingly, in May this year, the OpIndia team visited several districts in Purvanchal that faced the severe brunt of violence at the hands of Ansari and his henchman. During the visit, OpIndia spoke with BJP MLA Sushil Singh who made several shocking claims and called Mukhtar a traitor.It is important to note that different courts have served Mukhtar Ansari with punishment ranging from 2 years to life imprisonment in different cases. At present, hearings are underway in courts for 21 out of the 65 cases registered against him. He is currently lodged in Banda jail and is being kept under strict surveillance.In May, the OpIndia team had visited various districts of Purvanchal including Varanasi, Mau, Ghazipur, and Chandauli. These districts were once badly affected by the crimes of Mukhtar Ansari. During this Purvanchal tour, the OpIndia team met Sushil Singh, BJP MLA from Chandauli’s Saidaraja Assembly.Speaking with OpIndia, BJP MLA Sushil Singh had said that Mukhtar Ansari is not only a criminal but also a traitor. He asserted that Mukhtar Ansari not only committed various crimes but also committed offenses like stealing the army’s LMG (Light Machine Gun). Notably, Ansari reportedly bought the army’s LMG (Light Machine Gun) from an Army deserter in 2004 to penetrate Krishnanand Rai’s bullet-proof SUV.BJP MLA Sushil further told OpIndia that Mukhtar and his family have been involved in crime along with politics. He said that Mukhtar continued committing crimes because no one in his family suffered untimely death as a cost of his criminal enterprise, haece he doesn’t know how it feels to pay the price of violence. BJP MLA Sushil Singh told OpIndia that Mukhtar Ansari got at least 100 of his political opponents killed. It is alleged that these murders continued unabated under the patronage of the Samajwadi Party government. According to Sushil Singh, Mukhtar Ansari primarily targeted Hindus, orchestrating plans in which Hindus killed Hindus.BJP MLA Sushil Singh added that while the Samajwadi Party shielded and advocated the crimes of Mukhtar Ansari from Lucknow, the Congress did the same and protected him from Delhi. According to Sushil Singh, the Congress Party had imposed MCOCA on Mukhtar’s entire family at the latter’s instructions.Naming the then Vice President Hamid Ansari, the BJP MLA Singh alleged that Hamid Ansari used to lobby for Mukhtar by dialing the police station. Additionally, Hamid Ansari also missed his powers to register cases at the police station against those who stood against Mukhtar.Sushil Singh further added that Mukhtar Ansari, along with his political patrons like SP and Congress, not only got his opponents murdered, but also used to break them mentally by filing many cases against them. Sushil Singh noted that even in this bad time, he got the support of Narendra Modi and Yogi Adityanath, based on which he continued his struggle against Mukhtar Ansari.Speaking with OpIndia, BJP MLA Sushil Singh became emotional. He said that his innocent uncle Satish Singh, a farmer, was also murdered by Mukhtar Ansari. According to Sushil Singh, the murder was carried out to instill fear in the minds of people. He added that the murder of Krishnanand Rai was also done by Mukhtar Ansari to create terror.Recalling the year 2004, Sushil Singh mentioned that during Manoj Sinha’s Lok Sabha election campaign in Ghazipur, he had visited the area for campaigning. He claimed that the police had surrounded him intending to harm him. After leaving, several BJP workers were apprehended, held in the police station, and subjected to torture. According to him, he survived because of God’s grace. Sushil Singh also recalled the 2009 elections when there was a contest in the Lok Sabha elections in Varanasi between BJP’s Murli Manohar Joshi and Mukhtar Ansari. At that time, Sushil Singh was an MLA from the Bahujan Samaj Party.He alleges that, at Mukhtar Ansari’s behest, Mayawati imposed numerous cases on him overnight. According to him, this was done so that Sushil Singh could be murdered in the future. He admitted that at that time he was opposing Mukhtar Ansari and supporting Murli Manohar Joshi for Hindutva.BJP MLA Sushil Singh had claimed that even though the mafia don Mukhtar Ansari has become weak due to the change of government, the roots of his crime empire are still spread across UP. Sushil Singh admitted that many victims are still hesitant to come out due to fear of Mukhtar.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"18 December, 2023 ",Half of Bengal’s population will one day speak Urdu: Old video of Kolkata Mayor thanking Mamata Banerjee for making it second language goes viral,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/old-video-kolkata-mayor-firhad-hakim-urdu-propehcy-half-population-west-bengal-viral/,"In February 2012, Mamata Banerjee made Urdu the second language in areas of West Bengal where the population of Urdu speakers was equal or more than 10%.On Saturday (16th December), a video of incumbent Kolkata Mayor Firhad Hakim endorsing Urduisation of West Bengal went viral on social media.In a video shared on X (formerly Twitter) by user ‘Mintu Roy’, Hakim was heard saying, “Inshallah, one day will come when half of the population of Bengal will speak Urdu and recite poetry.” His remark aimed at the promotion of Urdu in West Bengal was greeted with applause by Muslims present at the event. It must be mentioned that Bengalis have a history of resisting the imposition of non-native languages particularly Urdu. Watch the video👇 pic.twitter.com/sXzRjE4yuBIn fact, one of the reasons leading up to the Bangladesh Liberation War was the imposition of Urdu over Bengali in then-East Pakistan. As such, the prophecy by Kolkata Mayor that half of the State of West Bengal will one day speak in Urdu was meant to spark controversy. The viral video of Firhad Hakim was recorded on 11th February 2021 during an event hosted by the West Bengal Urdu Academy.During the event dubbed ‘Mushaira 2021’, he was heard saying, “There was a time when Urdu speakers did not feel like they belonged to Bengal. There was no official status for Urdu. I want to thank Mamata Banerjee for making Urdu the second official language of Bengal.”“We have increased the budget of the Urdu Academy to ₹15 crore,” he informed. Firhad Hakim said that his ancestors came from Bihar and spoke Urdu at home. He also called upon the West Bengal Urdu Academy to take measures to propagate the language in the State of West Bengal.It must be mentioned that Mamata Banerjee engaged in appeasement politics soon after becoming the Chief Minister of West Bengal in 2011. A year later in February 2012, she made Urdu the second language in areas of the State where Urdu speakers were equal to or more than 10% of the population.The Trinamool Congress government had identified a total of 18 such Urdu-speaking areas -Goalpokhar I and II blocks, Islalmpur block, Kolkata Municipal Corporation, Islampur Municipality, Garulia Municipality, Titagarh Municipality, Kamarhati Municipality, Bhatpara Municipality, Champdani Municipality, Bansberia Municipality, Bhadreswar Municipality, Rishra Municipality, Asansol Municipal Corporation, Jamuria Municipality, Raniganj Municipality, Kulti Municipality and Bally Municipality.However, this is not the first time when the Mayor of Kolkata has been in the news for the wrong reasons. In April 2016, he had dubbed a Muslim-dominated area of Kolkata as ‘Mini-Pakistan‘ In February 2021, he was spotted delivering a political speech at a masjid in Kolkata, in blatant violation of the Model Code of Conduct. To pacify Muslim rioters during the anti-CAA movement, Firhad Hakim referred to them as ‘brothers.’ The Kolkata Mayor was earlier seen referring to the Central Armed forces and the BJP as ‘Suar er baccha‘ (progency of pigs).Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

The court also imposed a fine of Rs 10,000 on Ansari for threatening Mahavir Prasad Rungta, the brother of coal businessman and VHP treasurer Nand Kishore Rungta, who was kidnapped by Ansari’s henchman from his Varanasi office on 22nd January 1997. This was the jailed mafia’s seventh conviction since September last year. Ansari, who appeared through video conferencing, was visibly upset after hearing the ruling. Reportedly he began pleading with the judge. When Judge Ujjwal Upadhyay started pronouncing the sentence, Ansari sat with his head down and his hands on his forehead. Following this, he pleaded before the judge, saying, ‘Judge Sahab, please have mercy so that all my sentences proceed simultaneously.’ However, in the decision given by the court, it was already mentioned. Notably, Nand Kishore Rungta, a coal businessman from Jawahar Nagar of Bhelupur police station area of Varanasi, was murdered after being kidnapped on 22nd January 1997.

"14 December, 2023 ","N Ram pats his own back for a pompous, gassy editorial in The Hindu, The Wire has a monumental meltdown: Fallout of SC decision...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/n-ram-pompous-editorial-the-hindu-the-wire-meltdown-sc-decision-article-370/,"N.Ram, Siddarth Varadarajan and their ilk know very well that the Parliament can split or not split a state even when there is an elected government in place and the legislature wishes otherwise.On December 11th, the Supreme Court upheld the abolition of the dreaded Article 370 (I know it was repealed and therefore while Article 370 still exists in the Constitution, the original dreaded purpose for which it was intended doesn’t exist anymore). Certain sections of the English media; certain sections of the I.N.D.I alliance and the entire Congress party went bonkers over this decision of the Supreme Court. Watching their meltdowns gave me goosebumps, literally. Am sure that their WhatsApp groups buzzed with messages on what should be their best strategy on this topic. The line of argument they have chosen to bombard their readers/viewers is – Attack on Federalism! A long, pompous and gassy editorial was published in his newspaper, The Hindu (we will get it later in this article). N. Ram showed utmost humility and described his editorial as “clear-sighted and insightful”. A former CEO of The Hindu group of publications, Rajiv C. Lochan, dared to call out this humility of N.Ram on Twitter here (“Beware when one pats one’s own back”. He went on to comment that “the pervasive use of adjectives can’t strengthen a relatively weak set of arguments”. Rajiv Lochan was telling N. Ram that just because he used good English doesn’t mean that this editorial is insightful. Now, the unparalleled arrogance of N. Ram is well known. Occasionally he takes it upon himself to prove it yet again to all his readers. Rajiv Lochan provided the best opportunity for N. Ram to exhibit his famed arrogance and intolerance in public. True to his image, N. Ram use a lot of English words to convey a simple meaning. I would urge you to read the image below and have a hearty laugh at N. Ram’s meltdown! He is telling Rajiv Lochan that a mere CEO should shut up because there is no one better than N.Ram to have opinions in this whole world. How can a mere CEO comment in public about matters as trivial as Article 370? Imagine N. Ram’s attitude towards mere citizens if he goes bombastic like this on his former CEO! After reading the “clear-sighted and insightful” editorial about 3 to 5 times, I was able to find 2 sentences that summarized the arguments of the entire English media gang. The title of the editorial makes it sound like doomsday is near and we will die because of what the Supreme Court did! I have highlighted the relevant portion in the editorial that tells us that Parliament can now do anything while keeping a state under the President’s rule. This was what his compatriots at The Wire were also shrieking about. The meltdown at The Wire was even more monumental in proportions. Multiple opinion pieces popped up in a short time – all telling us the same thing – that there is no difference left between “democracy and dictatorship”; that there are “Serious implications” for the entire country; that this is an “attack on the basic structure of federalism”; and the best of all – Many “locals had feared” that they have been pushed into “meaningful silence”!Think about what these people are writing folks. What is wrong with “meaningful silence”? What is wrong with anything that is classified as “meaningful”? How can you use the word “meaningful” as a consequence of having “fear” to want it? N.Ram, Siddarth Varadarajan and their ilk know very well that the Parliament can split or not split a state even when there is an elected government in place and the legislature wishes otherwise. When she was the CM of UP, Mayawati passed a resolution in the UP Assembly asking the centre to split into 4 states. The then Home Minister flatly rejected the resolution. The disastrous manner in which AP was split into TS and AP is still fresh in many minds. The AP Legislature resolved that the state should not be split. Did that stop Sonia Gandhi from taking a stand otherwise? Examples galore exist on this topic. Starting from 1956 when their hero Nehru suspended the first elected communist government in the world in Kerala using a “brute majority” in Parliament. We can further discuss the language of Articles 1,2 and 3 in the Constitution of India. It wouldn’t serve any purpose for these people. We are approaching 10 years of Modi government. Despite their wonderful knowledge of the English language, these editors and owners have not been able to find new words, in the past 10 years, to describe their contempt towards the people of India for electing Modi. By rehashing the same words, and in the garb of being “insightful” and “clear-sighted”, all that these people have succeeded in was to show us how blinded they are to the reality of a new emerging Bharat. A Bharat that will embrace all meaningful decisions and leave behind all the meaningless trash these people dish out every day. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"13 December, 2023 ","As TV reporters shamelessly fight for smoke canister thrown in Parliament, here are a few things we should all be worried about after witnessing...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/journalists-fight-colour-canister-parliament-few-things-we-should-be-worried-about/,"If one truly thinks about it, the current TV journalists are merely following the standards set by veteran journalists like Rajdeep Sardesai who admitted that they were like vultures. On the 13th of December 2023, there was a serious security breach in the Parliament of India. Two individuals hurled a smoke canister from the viewer gallery. They then jumped to the floor of the house and were trying to make their way towards the speaker when were overpowered by parliamentarians. Thereafter they were detained by the police and taken for interrogation. Just as the security breach took place, there were two individuals outside the parliament protesting with similar colour smoke canisters. According to preliminary information from the Delhi Police, there is no terror angle to the incidents, however, the police are taking the breach seriously. According to reports, the intruder inside the parliament was chanting slogans about “Kaala Kanoon” and the protestors outside the Parliament were chanting slogans like Jai Bhim, Tanashahi Nahi Chalegi, Manipur ko Insaf do, etc. While the country was shocked by the serious security breach and the ramifications of the lapse, Indian media was conducting their very own circus. A video emerged where TV journalists were seen fighting like animals over the smoke canister that was hurled by the protestors. In the video put out by TV9, their journalist was showing the smoke canister on camera. While he was doing his segment, other journalists started trying to snatch the canister saying that he had used it enough and should hand over the canister to other journalists. When the other journalists started trying to snatch the canister, the TV9 journalist was seen almost sprinting with it, trying to get a few more seconds with the canister – for the sake of the hard-hitting coverage of the unfolding incident at the Parliament. As the nation had important questions that the media should have been focussing on – like how this security breach took place, who were the intruders, what were they chanting, why they did what they did, what was the police doing and how visitors entered the parliament with canisters and why were the Delhi Police so lackadaisical in arrested the protestors outside the Parliament, almost looking like they were taking them for a walk, these elements in the media seemed far more interested in ridiculous sensationalism and showing visuals of the canister. While we watched this circus unfold, there are several important aspects that people need to be extremely worried about. First and foremost, one has to wonder about the priorities of the media and what they choose to cover when important events unfold. As mentioned, there are very important questions that need to be answered as this security breach unfolds. The Parliament is not just a building but a symbol of the democracy of India and the seat of power. Any attack on the Parliament is an attack on democracy and the sovereignty of India itself. While these events unfolded, the journalists on the ground should have been far more focused on bringing crucial details to the people of the nation. And while several journalists were doing so, some were indulging in cheap sensationalism. This, however, comes as no surprise. One is reminded of the time when Rajdeep Sardesai was talking about the 2001 Parliament Attack – the terrorist attack that incidentally took place on this day 22 years ago. In 2018, a video had gone viral where Rajdeep Sardesai admitted that journalists were vultures. Sardesai in the video recounted the December 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament where he and his crew were preparing for a picnic owing to a slow news day. Preparing for a feast in the garden near the Parliament, he and his team entered the Parliament at around 11 am. Within minutes of the team entering the Parliament, he says they heard gunshots. The Parliament was attacked. He then recalled that when his colleague asked him to leave, he directed him to suggest the guard to close the gates. He explained with a wide grin that he did so so that no other channel crew could enter. Those days there were fewer channels and Sardesai was excited at the prospect of doing an exclusive story.He then says how the exclusive story of the parliament attack made the team forget the wine and kababs they were planning to picnic on. “It was a great day. We are like vultures. We feed on these moments.” he added.If one truly thinks about it, the current TV journalists are merely following the standards set by veteran vultures like Rajdeep Sardesai. While the conduct of the media was abysmal, what is far more concerning is the conduct of the Delhi Police and security agencies. When a security breach like this has taken place, one would imagine that the police and law enforcement agencies would ask the media to stand back – after all, 26/11 was a classic case of how the media could potentially jeopardise any rescue operation and investigation when such incidents take place. During the Mumbai Attack, the police allowed unbridled access to the media, resulting in journalists like Barkha Dutt potentially giving away crucial information on hostages from ISI handlers who were closely monitoring the media. Taking a lesson from the past, the police should have summarily kept the media away. That canister itself could be crucial evidence that the police need, instead, the media was yet again given unbridled access to play with the canister as if were some sort of a prop in a drama. On the 22nd anniversary of the ghastly 2001 Parliament attack, the parliament was under severe threat. There were Khalistani and other terror organisations which had issued threats against the Parliament. While now the police are claiming that the smoke was not harmful, while the breach was ongoing, the police had to function under the assumption that it could be a deadly terror attack which could have dire ramifications. Despite that, the media was given unbridled access knowing fully well that such media has a history of creating a circus during serious incidents. Several other questions are being raised against the police as the Parliament’s security was breached. Visitors to the Parliament are frisked at every stage and there are now questions being asked as to how the security could have been so wanting that two individuals with smoke canisters could enter the Parliament. Per protocol, those who have passes to view the Parliament proceedings are not allowed to carry a paper inside the Parliament. Legitimate concerns are now being raised as to how, amid such tight security, two individuals could enter with these canisters. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"11 December, 2023 ",Chadar of sanitised history over ugly side of ‘Sufi saints’: I got death threats by Islamists for talking about historical facts – so let...,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/nupur-j-sharma-moinuddin-chisti-sufi-saints-demand-arrest-threats-statement/,"Since the Islamists have been relentlessly demanding my arrest, I must place on record that if needed, I will be more than willing to defend my position in a court of law.On the 2nd of December, I interviewed the Son of Hamas – Mosab Hassan Yousef. He is the son of one of the founders of Hamas Sheikh Hassan Yousef. The interview was necessitated after a Hindu boy from Kashmir started getting Sar Tan Se Juda threats after he shared an old interview snippet of Yousef, where he was talking about Islam. After the boy from NIT Srinagar was threatened by the Islamist mob, Yousef took to his X page and posted that the Jihadis should go after him and leave the boy alone. In his interview with me, he categorically said that if anyone touched the Hindu boy, the repercussions would be dire. Beyond the NIT Srinagar case, Yousef and I also spoke at length about Islam, Islamism and the fate of the rest of the world in the face of a cult that was perpetually offended and believed that the use of violence to express that offence was their divine right – nay – duty. During the discussion, Yousef mentioned how Sufism was one of the most peaceful, spiritual branches of Islam. A Hindu, however, knows that this statement rings hollow. I told Yousef that as a Hindu, I find it difficult to make sense of that perception since Hindus have been raped and murdered by Sufis. As an example of the Sufi onslaught against Hindus, I cited the example of Moinuddin Chisti, how cows were slaughtered and Hindu Temples desecrated and also alluded to the Ajmer Dargah rape scandal where the self-proclaimed descendants of Moinuddin Chisti and the custodians of his legacy raped hundreds of Hindu girls and blackmailed them – a sordid saga from 1992. It is pertinent to mention here that I don’t blame Mosab Hassan Yousef for the views he holds on Sufism. Many Hindus themselves believe that Sufism is peaceful and spiritual. In fact, a chunk of the business that the Amer Dargah gets is from Hindus who visit the shrine – not Muslims. Even though it was some of the Chistis associated with the Ajmer Dargah who had issued death threats to Nupur Sharma and called for her beheading. Khadim Gauhar Chishti of Ajmer Dargah had links to Kanhaiya Lal’s murder. Khadim of Ajmer Dargah named Gauhar Chishti had met one of the killers of the Hindu tailor. Ajmer Dargah Khadim Salman Chishti threatened to kill Nupur Sharma. The history-sheeter with over 13 cases filed against him, including murder and attempt to murder, claimed that he would hand over his house to anyone who brings Sharma’s head. Sarwar Chishti of the Anjuman Committee of the Ajmer dargah had said “The situation in the country right now, is such that people are committing blasphemy. They are doing mischief in the glory of the Prophet, in the glory of the Khwaja. We will not tolerate this at all. We will launch such a massive agitation that the whole Hindustan will shake.” Sarwar Chishti had called himself a member of the PFI. In 2020, he defended PFI saying the organisation was ”saving India’s constitution”. He had also called for a boycott of Hindus. Syed Aadil Chishti – son of Sarwar Chishti – mocked Hindu deities after the Nupur Sharma incident.Nothing I said was historically inaccurate and I will come to that. Days after the interview, a clip where I mentioned Moinuddin Chisti was shared on social media by Islamists, claiming that I had insulted the Sufi ‘saint’ and I should be arrested. What started with the hashtag #ArrestNupurJSharma soon turned into a free-for-all – I got death threats, rape threats and the usual ‘Sar Tan se Juda’ threats. My reaction was the chuckle at the irony of it all. After all, my statement came just as it was being claimed that Sufis are peaceful and spiritual – a model for all Muslims to follow. Here is a sneak peak into their spiritual moorings: While the peaceful Sufis demanded for my head and arrest, I held my peace for 3 days – not because I was scared but because I believed that their outrage would die down. It did not. I believe sunlight is the best disinfectant. I believe the truth – historical facts – can’t be suppressed simply because some people are offended by it. As an American conservative says, ‘facts don’t care about your feelings’. I have repeated over and over again the purpose of my professional existence – I picked up my pen because ‘they’ sold theirs. I would not do justice to my role or my readers if I don’t stand by the truth. If I cower today. And therefore, I feel it necessary to substantiate my statement with historical evidence. With regards to Sufism, there is a broad perception that it is a peaceful, spiritual sect of Islam. However, there are certain myths attached to this notion that need honest conversation. Historically, several genocides against Hindus and crimes against their faith/places of worship have been led by Sufis or have been conducted at the behest of Sufis. It is a matter of historical record that eighteenth-century Sufi preacher Shah Waliullah’s letters to Islamic rulers and nobles show that he was very keen on rejuvenating Islamic supremacy in Delhi, which had started to loosen its grip over the sub-continent after Aurangzeb’s death. According to the book by Saiyid Athar Abbas Rizvi, Shah Waliullah wrote a letter to Ahmad Shah Abdali, the invader from Afghanistan, inviting him to India to establish Islamic supremacy by suppressing Hindus.From the invite to Ahmad Shah Abdali to the mastermind of the Noakhali genocide belonging to a Sufi sect – Shah Syed Gholam Sarwar Husseini, the hereditary pir of Dayra Sharif, a Sufi shrine in Noakhali, Sufism has a chequered history – one which is well documented – a history of genocide, enslavement, forced conversion and establishment of the supremacy of Islam. Those Sufis who refused to adhere to Orthodox Islam were persecuted – the sects we talk about today were not. MA Khan writes that Sufi leaders had poured into India along with the Turkic invaders and most of them, Nizamuddin Aulia, Aamir Khasrau, Nasiruddin Chiragh, Moinuddin Chishti and Jalaluddin etc, were all known for holding the Ulemas, orthodox Islamic scholars in high esteem. Khan further writes that though Nizamuddin Aulia and Moinuddin Chishti were among the most unorthodox when it came to music and dance, in the matters of Islam and Islamic supremacy, they held the words of the Ulema as sacrosanct. “What the Ulema seeks to achieve through speech, the Sufis achieve by behaviour,” Nizamuddin Aulia had said.The great Sufi saint Nasiruddin Chiragh had reportedly banned all practices that were deviant from the Sharia. Khan quotes Prof KA Nizami to describe what the Sufi leader Ghazzali had told in terms of Jihad, the Islamic religious war against Kafirs. Ghazzali had written that his followers must go on Jihad at least once a year and should bring down the fortresses of non-Muslims, they should cut down their throats drown them and burn their holy books. Jihadists may take whatever booty they desire. Toeing the orthodox line, Nizamuddin Aulia had condemned the Hindus of India to the ‘fires of hell’. He had also written that even if non-Muslims embrace Islam, the faith will not benefit them, because they had been unbelievers. He had added, “He, (Allah) has created paradise and hell for the believers and the infidels respectively to repay the wicked they (infidels) have done.” Now, coming to the specific comments in question about Moinuddin Chisti – one made during an interview with the Son of Hamas – Mosab Hassan Yousef. It is necessary to place on record that in the full video interview uploaded on YouTube, the mention of Moinuddin Chisti had long been redacted. Let me explain why. When I asked the question about Sufism and Hindus, I intended to talk about the campaign of certain Sufis against Hindus – which has been documented throughout history – even as recently as 1992. In the video description, I have explained that when I spoke of rape, I was referring to the Ajmer Dargah Rape scandal where hundreds of Hindu girls were raped with the active connivance and participation of the Khadims of Ajmer Dargah – the Chistis – who claim to be the descendants of Moinuddin Chisti. Farooq Chisti was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2007, but in 2013, the Rajasthan High Court deemed he had served ‘enough’ time and therefore, released him. The Ajmer Dargah still associates itself with him and his local clout has remained intact. Nafis Chist was absconding until 2003, before being caught by the Delhi Police while trying to escape, wearing a burqa. He is currently out on bail and respected in a similar way in Ajmer. These are facts. In the second part of the question, I spoke about cows being slaughtered and thrown into Hindu temples. I also spoke about the desecration of Hindu temples and the Jihad waged by Moinuddin Chisti – this assertion is again documented in history. Here is an excerpt from the book “Islamic Jihad” by MA Khan. Khan writes further that every day, Khwaja’s followers used to bring a cow and they used to slaughter it near a prominent temple where the local Raja and Hindus used to pray, cook kebabs from the cow’s meat to eat, just to show contempt towards the local Hindus. Chishti had come to India to fight Jihad on the side of the Sultan Muhammad Ghauri against the Hindu King Prithviraj Chauhan. Chishti had credited himself for Prithviraj’s capture, writing, “We have seized Pithaura (Prithviraj) and handed him to the army of Islam.” In addition, this is what a previous version of the website of Ajmer Dargah itself said and I quote, “When he had settled down in Ajmer, the Khawaja Sahib had a special reminder about his marriage through a ‘Basharat’ (prophetic dream) from the Holy prophet sometime in 590 AH or 1193 AD. The Prophet said, “O Moinuddin, You are a great preceptor of our religion. You should not depart from our ‘sunnah’ (meaning marriage which is incumbent upon every Muslim under the laws of Shariat). Coincidentally that very night Malik-a-Khitab devotee of Hazrat Khawaja Sahib, had captured a Raja’s daughter in an encounter who embraced Islam and Khawaja sahib, in response to the above reminder, married her giving her the Islamic name of Bibi Ummutulla..” Here is an archive link to the page: https://web.archive.org/web/20180319103851/http://dargahajmer.com/married-life/ This is also substantiated in A History Of Sufism in India, Sayyad Athar Abbas Rizvi, Vol 1, pg. 124. However, since the snippet in the video was not an explainer and merely a question, I realized it may be misinterpreted and therefore, the mention of the individual was removed. It bodes well, however, to repeat on record that I stand by the rest of my statement. Since the Islamists have been relentlessly demanding my arrest, I must place on record that if needed, I will be more than willing to defend my position in a court of law.It is said that the most effective way to destroy people is to deny and obliterate their own understanding of their history. For what little my contribution is worth, I refuse to be a part of that obliteration – I will not be silenced. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"18 December, 2023 ","‘Islam is incompatible with Europian culture’: 5-year-old video of Italian PM Giorgia Meloni goes viral, reported as recent statement",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/islam-is-incompatible-with-europian-culture-5-year-old-video-of-italian-pm-giorgia-meloni-goes-viral-fact-check/,"In the video, Meloni is seen saying, ""Salvini says that Islam is incompatible with the constitution? Ask him for clarification, but I believe that Islam certainly presents incompatibility with our values ​​and our civilization, and what happens in Islamic centers demonstrates this. This does not mean generalizing, but there is an incompatibility with our culture.""on 17th and 18th December, a video of Italian PM Giorgia Meloni went viral on social media. As per the subtitles in the video, she was seen saying that Islam is not compatible with European values and culture. Islam is being perpetrated (in Italy) through Saudi Arabia’s funding and Saudi Arabia has Sharia law. Meloni further says that the Sharia law is not compatible with Europian values and culture.

A number of Indian media houses including WION, Hindustan Times, Mint, NDTV, and Times Now reported the same claims. NDTV used a X post embed of a handle named Geopolitical Kid and wrote that Meloni’s statement was given during the political event organised by her party. However, Meloni’s statement regarding Islam’s alleged incompatibility wasn’t found in any international publications in the last 24-hour window. Radio Genoa, a popular handle on X, seemed to have first posted the video. Italian PM Giorgia Meloni: “I believe that there is a problem of compatibility between Islamic culture and the values ​​and rights of our civilization. The Islamic cultural centers in Italy are financed by Saudi Arabia where Sharia is in force. In Europe there is a very… pic.twitter.com/wEn8Fl4JC2However, Radio Genoa has not cited a time frame, and has not written that Meloni’s statement was recent. Upon searching with the keywords and comparing it with Meloni’s video clip going viral, we found that the original video was posted on YouTube back in 2018. The video was posted by the YouTube channel alanews in 2018. The original video can be seen here. In the video, Meloni is seen saying, “Salvini says that Islam is incompatible with the constitution? Ask him for clarification, but I believe that Islam certainly presents incompatibility with our values ​​and our civilization, and what happens in Islamic centers demonstrates this. This does not mean generalizing, but there is an incompatibility with our culture.”In that video, Meloni was referring to a previous statement by another conservative leader Matteo Salvini. Salvini, referring to the Cologne mass sexual attacks and Berlin terrorist attack, had said that Islam is incompatible with European values. Salvni is a leader of Italy’s Lega Nord party. Conclusion: While the viral video of Giorgia Meloni is mostly correct in rough translation, the video, or the statement, are not recent. They are from 5 years ago, and not from the recent political event organised by Meloni’s party. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"18 December, 2023 ",Fact Check: Did Pakistani caretaker PM confirm that unknown men poisoned Dawood Ibrahim? Here is the truth,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/fact-check-pakistani-caretaker-pm-dawood-ibrahim-death-confirmation/,"Dawood Ibrahim was designated as a global terrorist in 2003 by India and the United States with a reward of US$25 million for his capture for his believed role in the 1993 Bombay bombings. On Monday (18th December), social media was abuzz with rumours of the death of wanted terrorist Dawood Ibrahim, who has been hiding in Pakistan for decades. As per the rumours, Ibrahim was poisoned by an unknown person, and he was rushed to hospital. Some posts on social media claimed he was critical, while others claimed that he died. The rumours began spreading on Sunday (17th December) after Pakistan’s internet went down.Amid the rumours, an alleged screenshot of caretaker Prime Minister of Pakistan, Anwaar Ul Haq Kakar, went viral on social media with claims that the said post confirmed the death of Ibrahim. The post read, “The Messiah of humanity, dear to every Pakistani heart, our beloved His Excellency Dawood Ibrahim passed away due to poisoned by unknown. He breathed his last in a hospital in Karachi. May Allah grant him the highest position in Jannat. Inna Lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji’un.”However, when OpIndia investigated the screenshot and the official handle of the Pakistani PM, we found that there was no such tweet. Furthermore, the handle used in the screenshot was anwaar_kakkar, while the real ID of the Pakistani PM is anwaar_kakar. There is a handle called anwaar_kakkar, but that is a fan account of PM Kakar, and there was no such tweet either. It was evident that someone artificially created the post by adding text and a Grey Verified Check Mark on the fan account.Pakistani journalists also fuelled the rumours. In a recent episode of Bheja Fry, Pakistani journalist Aarzoo Kazmi talked about the rumours surrounding the poisoning of Dawood Ibrahim and his critical health in the hospital. She highlighted the fact that there was an internet shutdown in the country and emphasised that something was happening in Pakistan. She also talked about the rumours of Dawood Ibrahim’s poisoning and critical health. While she fanned the rumours, the rumours of Ibrahim’s death remained unconfirmed.As per Aaj Tak, Ibrahim was indeed admitted to the hospital two days back. It is unclear what was the reason, but several reports talked about the rumours of him being poisoned.Though the rumours of Ibrahim’s death remained unconfirmed, it was indeed a fact that internet services faced a massive crackdown in Pakistan on 17th December. Social media services and search engines stopped working without any prior notice. No one could access social media platforms like X, Facebook, YouTube, etc., and the Google search engine was down. While it was rumoured that the crackdown was because of the poisoning of Ibrahim, in reality, it appeared that the Pakistani government shut down the internet to limit the access and circulation of videos of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s virtual rally.Dawood Ibrahim is one of the most notorious and dreaded gangsters that India has ever seen. A criminal mobster and drug dealer in Mumbai. It is believed that he now resides in Karachi, Pakistan. He was designated as a global terrorist in 2003 by India and the United States with a reward of US$25 million for his capture for his believed role in the 1993 Bombay bombings. In 2011, the FBI and Forbes named him number three on The World’s 10 Most Wanted Fugitives.While Ibrahim’s death rumours are all over social media, it has to be noted that such rumours find their place on social media platforms once or twice every year. It is a fact that Ibrahim is hiding in Pakistan, and the hostile neighbour categorically refused to accept his presence in the country.OpIndia’s detailed report on terrorists being killed by unnamed assailants in Pakistan can be checked here.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

The X users circulated the visuals from the Gomti bridge with misleading claims that the authority scattered their goods and assaulted the vendors. However, they were immediately fact-checked by the Lucknow Police. Spinning Police action as oppression of the poor, Asif Khan tweeted, “Poor Kashmiri dry fruit vendors were harassed by Lucknow Municipality team.

VIP movement traverses through this route because of which the  Municipal corporation and police regularly carry out anti-encroachment drives.”Misleading. @zoo_bear won't share that – vendors were asked to vacate no-vending zone several times before.

He added that the corporation had taken action previously, and the police had communicated with the vendors. East DCP Lucknow mentioned that today (17th December), the convoy of UP CM Yogi Adityanath also passed through this route. He added that today the dry fruit vendors showed indecency with the anti-encroachment team. Subsequently, when the police came to learn about the incident, they used the necessary force and brought the youths to the police station. They have been informed that this is a VIP route adding that they should cooperate with the anti-encroachment drives in the future as well.It is also notable that while the X users claimed police threw away the dry fruits being sold by the street vendors, others have said that the vendors themselves dropped the products on the streets after police asked them to vacate the place. Therefore, the police removed the street vendors not because of their identities as Kashmiris, but only because they were vending at an unauthorised place.

Looks like your newsroom is filled with Stalin fanbois from radical left universities.As per various Russian accounts, a whopping 20 million people are said to have perished under Joseph Stalin’s regime, after being at the receiving end of labour camps, forced collectivisation, famine and executions.Besides these measures, Stalin had also initially colluded with the Nazis during the latter’s Polish invasion in 1939 and at the end of the war, the Communist soldiers under Stalin have been alleged to have raped at least 2 million German women.In a century, communist states have killed approximately 100 million people, according to Ilya Somin’s articles. Joseph Stalin’s attempts to collectivise agriculture and production in Russia resulted in the deaths of 6 to 10 million people. Stalin imposed collective agriculture, prohibiting people from cultivating on their own, and imprisoning dissenters in Siberian labour camps. In Russia and Ukraine, millions went hungry, and hundreds of thousands died in prison camps. When Ukrainian production fell short of Stalin’s quota, he punished them even more by taking away everything they had. In Ukraine, Stalin’s forced famine is termed ‘Holodomor’ by joining the words for hunger (holod) and mor (extermination or mass-murder).Stalin’s atrocities were not restricted to the Soviet famine; he also carried out the ‘Great Purge,’ in which everyone he disapproved of was imprisoned, tortured, or executed. No one was spared, even wealthy peasants, politicians, military men, and ethnic minorities. The Purge alone is thought to have killed over 1.2 million people.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

Interestingly some of the others who also helped him have now switched to the BJP,"" Sardesai had claimed.Days after the Income Tax (IT) Department recovered a whopping ₹353 crore from the offices of Dhiraj Prasad Sahu, ‘journalist’ Rajdeep Sardesai came to the rescue of the Congress MP.In a video posted on his YouTube channel on Friday (16th December), Sardesai claimed that the scam-tainted politician had no chance of being a Parliamentarian. While citing a make-believe ‘source’, he alleged that the Congress wanted to deny Sahu a ticket to the Rajya Sabha in 2018. The controversial ‘journalist’ claimed that the party relented after leaders, who have now defected to the BJP, lobbied for him. He also made reference to a ‘dead’ Congress leader who supposedly influenced the decision of the party to send Dhiraj Prasad Sahu to the Rajya Sabha.At a time when the grand-old-party is under scanner over allegations of corruption, Rajdeep Sardesai was seen making a last-ditch effort to give a clean chit to the Congress’ high command.“A senior Congress leader from Jharkhand claims Sahu was to be denied a ticket in 2018 but he reportedly managed to get his Rajya Sabha nomination at the very last moment with the help of a very key people in the Congress hierarchy in the National Capital,” he was heard saying.“Among his key benefactors is someone who is no longer alive and held the purse strings of the Congress for a very long time. Interestingly some of the others who also helped him have now switched to the BJP,” Sardesai brazened out.Dhiraj Prasad Sahu is a Rajya Sabha MP for Congress from Jharkhand. His family has been associated with the Congress party since independence. He became RS MP in by-polls in 2009 for the first time. In 2010, he was elected as RS MP for the second time; in 2018, he was re-elected for RS by Congress for the third time. He actively participates in parliamentary proceedings. Sahu was part of Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Yatra. In recent raids at Odisha-based Boudh Distillery Pvt Ltd, where Dhiraj Prasad Sahu is a partner, the Income Tax Department recovered ₹353 cr of unaccounted cash.

"14 December, 2023 ","News24 posts misleading tweet on Muslim sculptors making idol of Ram Lalla, here are the facts on the idols being made for the Ram...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/news24-posts-misleading-tweet-on-muslim-sculptors-making-idol-of-ram-lalla/,"While Muslim sculptor Jamaluddin and his son are making fibre statues of Lord Ram for decorative purposes, News24 claimed they are making Ram Lalla idol to be placed in Ram MandirAs the date for grand opening of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya approaches, various updates about the temple are being reported by the media. However, misleading and fake news are also being published by some media houses regarding the Ram Mandir. One such false information was provided by News24, which claimed that the idol of Ram Lalla to be installed in the temple is being made by a Muslim sculptor and his son.On 14th December, News24 posted a tweet on X, claiming that Muhammad Jamaluddin from West Bengal and his son Bittu are sculpting the idol of Ram Lalla, which will take its place in the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. The tweet in Hindi said, “Ramlalla is ready to sit in the Ram temple of Ayodhya in January.” After that, the media houses added four bullet points, the first of which said, “The idols were made by Mohammad Jamaluddin of Bengal and his son Bittu.”News24 then said in the post that father-son duo has been crafting idols for a long time. The post then added remarks by Jamaluddin, who said, ‘Religion is a personal thing. People following many religions live in our country. The culture of brotherhood is my message as an artiste.’By saying that Jamaluddin and his son are making the idol of Ram Lall to be placed in Ram Mandir, News24 implied that the Muslim duo is making the main idol to placed in the sanctum sanctorum of the temple. But this is completely fake and misleading claim, and no Muslim is making the main idol of Ram Lalla.In fact, other media reports on Jamaluddin make it clear that he is making a decorating idol using fibre for the opening ceremony of Ram Mandir. As per a report by India Today, Mohammed Jamaluddin and his son Bittu have been engaged in creating some statues that will adorn the temple complex. The report stated that he is making life-size fibre statues.Other reports make it clear that the fibre statutes of Lord Ram and other Gods will be used to decorate the temple complex and the Ayodhya City during the inauguration ceremony. TV9 reported that statues of Lord Ram will be placed in major intersections in Ayodhya, and some of these idols are being made by Jamaluddin and his son.After several social media users pointed out the misleading claim made by News24, the media house later deleted the tweet.Fibre idols are generally used for decorative purposes, and they are not used as the main deity in temples. Most deities in Hindu temples are made from various types of stones, while temporary idols made for annual festivals are made using clay. Fibre idols last longer than clay, but are much easier to make compared to carving stone. Fibre idols are generally made for export, as they are lighter and easy to transport with the risk of damage. Notably, not one but three idols of Ram Lalla are being made in Ayodhya by three separate artists, and one of them will be picked by a committee to be placed in Sanctum Santorum, after which the pran pratistha rituals will be conducted by priests. Champat Rai, general secretary of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Trust, had earlier informed that the three different idols are being made by three sculptors – Ganesh Bhatt and Arun Yogiraj from Karnataka and Satyanarayan Pandey from Jaipur. Two of the idols are being made using two stones from Karnataka and one from Rajasthan. Earlier, a stone was brought from Nepal, and later stones were also brought from Odisha and Maharashtra to carve the idol, but those were found not suitable.Ganesh Bhatt of Karnataka is carving out the idol from Nellikaru rock or black stones which is also known as Shyam shila or Krishna shila. Famous sculptor Arun Yogiraj of Mysore, who sculpted the 12-ft statue of Adi Shankaracharya unveiled by PM Modi in Kedarnath, is sculpting another idol using another rock from Karnataka. Satya Narayan Pandey of Rajasthan is carving the Ram Lalla idol from white Makrana marble stones. All three artists are chiselling the idols based on a sketch by renowned artist Vasudeo Kamath from Mumbai.The 51-inch-tall Ram Lalla depicts the child form of Lord Ram, same as the current smaller idol that was placed in the makeshift temple for over half a century. The idol will depict five-year-old Ram Lalla sitting on a lotus, carrying a bow in one hand and an arrow in the other. Many other symbols related to Lord Ram will carved on the statue.While one idol will be selected to be permanently placed in the sanctum sanctorum, the other two idols will be placed in prominent places inside the temple premises.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"14 December, 2023 ","N Ram pats his own back for a pompous, gassy editorial in The Hindu, The Wire has a monumental meltdown: Fallout of SC decision...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/n-ram-pompous-editorial-the-hindu-the-wire-meltdown-sc-decision-article-370/,"N.Ram, Siddarth Varadarajan and their ilk know very well that the Parliament can split or not split a state even when there is an elected government in place and the legislature wishes otherwise.On December 11th, the Supreme Court upheld the abolition of the dreaded Article 370 (I know it was repealed and therefore while Article 370 still exists in the Constitution, the original dreaded purpose for which it was intended doesn’t exist anymore). Certain sections of the English media; certain sections of the I.N.D.I alliance and the entire Congress party went bonkers over this decision of the Supreme Court. Watching their meltdowns gave me goosebumps, literally. Am sure that their WhatsApp groups buzzed with messages on what should be their best strategy on this topic. The line of argument they have chosen to bombard their readers/viewers is – Attack on Federalism! A long, pompous and gassy editorial was published in his newspaper, The Hindu (we will get it later in this article). N. Ram showed utmost humility and described his editorial as “clear-sighted and insightful”. A former CEO of The Hindu group of publications, Rajiv C. Lochan, dared to call out this humility of N.Ram on Twitter here (“Beware when one pats one’s own back”. He went on to comment that “the pervasive use of adjectives can’t strengthen a relatively weak set of arguments”. Rajiv Lochan was telling N. Ram that just because he used good English doesn’t mean that this editorial is insightful. Now, the unparalleled arrogance of N. Ram is well known. Occasionally he takes it upon himself to prove it yet again to all his readers. Rajiv Lochan provided the best opportunity for N. Ram to exhibit his famed arrogance and intolerance in public. True to his image, N. Ram use a lot of English words to convey a simple meaning. I would urge you to read the image below and have a hearty laugh at N. Ram’s meltdown! He is telling Rajiv Lochan that a mere CEO should shut up because there is no one better than N.Ram to have opinions in this whole world. How can a mere CEO comment in public about matters as trivial as Article 370? Imagine N. Ram’s attitude towards mere citizens if he goes bombastic like this on his former CEO! After reading the “clear-sighted and insightful” editorial about 3 to 5 times, I was able to find 2 sentences that summarized the arguments of the entire English media gang. The title of the editorial makes it sound like doomsday is near and we will die because of what the Supreme Court did! I have highlighted the relevant portion in the editorial that tells us that Parliament can now do anything while keeping a state under the President’s rule. This was what his compatriots at The Wire were also shrieking about. The meltdown at The Wire was even more monumental in proportions. Multiple opinion pieces popped up in a short time – all telling us the same thing – that there is no difference left between “democracy and dictatorship”; that there are “Serious implications” for the entire country; that this is an “attack on the basic structure of federalism”; and the best of all – Many “locals had feared” that they have been pushed into “meaningful silence”!Think about what these people are writing folks. What is wrong with “meaningful silence”? What is wrong with anything that is classified as “meaningful”? How can you use the word “meaningful” as a consequence of having “fear” to want it? N.Ram, Siddarth Varadarajan and their ilk know very well that the Parliament can split or not split a state even when there is an elected government in place and the legislature wishes otherwise. When she was the CM of UP, Mayawati passed a resolution in the UP Assembly asking the centre to split into 4 states. The then Home Minister flatly rejected the resolution. The disastrous manner in which AP was split into TS and AP is still fresh in many minds. The AP Legislature resolved that the state should not be split. Did that stop Sonia Gandhi from taking a stand otherwise? Examples galore exist on this topic. Starting from 1956 when their hero Nehru suspended the first elected communist government in the world in Kerala using a “brute majority” in Parliament. We can further discuss the language of Articles 1,2 and 3 in the Constitution of India. It wouldn’t serve any purpose for these people. We are approaching 10 years of Modi government. Despite their wonderful knowledge of the English language, these editors and owners have not been able to find new words, in the past 10 years, to describe their contempt towards the people of India for electing Modi. By rehashing the same words, and in the garb of being “insightful” and “clear-sighted”, all that these people have succeeded in was to show us how blinded they are to the reality of a new emerging Bharat. A Bharat that will embrace all meaningful decisions and leave behind all the meaningless trash these people dish out every day. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"18 December, 2023 ","After banning animal sacrifice at Shyama Mai Temple, the next target may be Maa Kali’s narmund mala: How this Sanatana tradition differs from Bakrid",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/animal-sacrifice-at-shyama-mai-temple-how-this-sanatana-tradition-differs-from-bakrid/,"The devotees have questioned the intentions of the state government as the ban on Pashubali is being seen as tying the hands of the devotees who have faith in Shyama Mai and have been sacrificing animals for generations.The Bihar government has announced a ban on the practice of Pashubali (animal sacrifice) in the Shyama Mai Temple of Darbanga. The decision of the Bihar Government has angered the Hindu devotees. The Bihar State Religious Trust Council, chaired by Akhilesh Kumar Jain, imposed the ban. Jain was previously Law Secretary. Hindus have started agitation against the decision, demanding his resignation. They also burnt his effigy. Devotees are saying that Hindu traditions are being played with. They questioned why the state government is interfering in the practice that has been going on since ancient times in the temple.Currently, the Bihar government is being run by the alliance of JDU, RJD and Congress headed by Nitish Kumar. Tejashwi Yadav is the deputy CM of the state. Following the state government’s decision, several Hindu organizations, including Bajrang Dal, have imposed the decision. Notably, all parties ruling the state government oppose the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). While the BJP is vocal on Hindutva issues, the state government’s decision is being seen as against Hindu tradition. The devotees have questioned the intentions of the state government as the ban on Pashubali is being seen as tying the hands of the devotees who have faith in Shyama Mai and have been sacrificing animals for generations.Notably, the Shyama Mai Temple is on the funeral pyre of Maharaj Rameshwar Singh of Darbhanga. Raja Rameshwar Singh was a devotee of Kali Maa and practised Tantra Sidhi. This is why the temple is also called Rameshwari Mai Temple. The temple was constructed in 1933 by his son Kameshwar Singh. Talking about the temple’s sanctum sanctorum, Mahakal is installed on the right side of the idol of Maa Kali and Ganapati and Batukbhairav are installed on the left side.The Mundamala around the neck of Maa Kali has the same number of Narmunds as the number of letters in the Hindi alphabet. The Hindi alphabet is also considered a symbol of creation. Special events are being organized here during Navratri. Devi Maa is worshipped here in both Vedic and Tantric processes. In ‘Rameshwar Charit Mithila Ramayana’, Laldas, the servant of Maharaj, also describes Shyama Mai as the form of Mata Sita. In this story, Lord Ram was hit by an arrow from the demon Sahastranand, after which the angry Mata Sita’s complexion turned black, and her tongue came out.This form of her was called Shyama Mai. It is said that Lord Shiva himself had to come to calm his anger. There are two things worth noting here – first, it is a Shakta temple, a place of goddess worship. Secondly, Tantra Sadhana has also been taking place in the temple since the beginning. Both of these are part of the Sanatan Hindu tradition. Animal sacrifices are made in Tantra Sadhna practices.Bihar State Religious Trust Council has banned the practice of sacrifice, citing the Cruelty to Animals Act. The protesters have decided that hundreds of people will gather and sacrifice animals in the temple premises as a mark of non-cooperation with this order of the state government.This is not the first time a government has banned Pashubali. In October-November 2020, an FIR was registered against those who sacrificed animals in the Durga temple of Kamathi in Nagpur, Maharashtra. In Kerala, animal sacrifice was banned by making a law.Speaking to OpIndia, Mohit Bhardwaj, founder of ‘Vedic India’ and an expert on Hindu traditions, said that animal sacrifice is allowed in the Hindu religion but with many rules and restrictions. He said that in the Hindu religion, many communities offer animals as food to the deity. He gave the example of Shrauta and Grihya Sutras, in which animal sacrifice is permitted. Suchitra Samanta said in a research paper published in the ‘Association for Asian Studies’ that animal sacrifice is allowed in many Tantras and Puranas.In the Hindu religion, there are provisions for offering meat and vegetables as food to the Gods and Goddesses. Animal sacrifice has special importance in Goddess worship. For example, meat is also offered as Prasad to the Goddess in Bengal during Navratri. Animal sacrifice is common there, as it is part of the Shakta tradition. Since ancient times, animal sacrifice has been done in the worship of Shakti and Tantra Sadhana.Notably, the forest dweller community, which is part of Hinduism, offers meat as Prasad to the Gods and Goddesses as part of their daily routine. However, the “secular” law of India has stopped it. On the other hand, if someone kills an animal to eat meat, it is justified. It is evident that the religious traditions of only one community are being disrespected and stopped.If the government wants to ban animal sacrifice, they should not allow such practices on Bakrid as well, where rivers of blood flow. Not to forget, Muslims follow the ‘Halal’ way of killing animals, where they are tortured and killed slowly. Interestingly, no one sees animal cruelty in that practice. Since there is unity in Muslim society, the political parties have to follow the path of appeasement, and they often avoid meddling with their traditions.However, when it comes to Hindus, the governments become the contractors of the religion. It is a fact that the Islamic way of killing animals is barbaric. However, it should be the basis for the government or courts’ decisions regarding Hindu traditions. Hindu society needs to wake up and pay attention to preserve its traditions. The government has no right to ban animal sacrifice.दरभंगा श्यामा माई मंदिर में बलि प्रदान पर रोक से लोगों में आक्रोश। pic.twitter.com/KV7GjBmyPyThe Supreme Court had allowed women to worship at the Sabarimala Temple in Kerala based on a petition filed by activists with no faith in Hinduism. Misinformation was spread about the temple, and it was anti-women. Girls and elderly women are allowed to worship in Sabarimala Temple. On the other hand, the government or judiciary do not decide who will enter a mosque and who will not.The Hindu religion will operate as decided by the traditions of the temples, scriptures, history, and opinions of the Hindu scholars, not by the government or the court. Sanatan Dharma has seen several changes since it came into existence. Some practices were added, and some were removed, but society did them. At that time, courts and governments did not exist in their present form. After a few days, the government may come and say that Maa Kali should not wear Narmund and it should be removed as it promotes violence. Will Hindus accept it?Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources. We need your support to fight them.

"8 December, 2023 ",High priest to lead the consecration ceremony of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya is a descendant of priest who presided over the coronation of Chhatrapati...,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/know-the-shivaji-connection-of-priest-who-will-lead-ram-temple-consecration/,"More than 40 scholars from Kashi and 121 from all branches of the Vedas throughout India are scheduled to be guided by him during the solemn idol consecration ceremonies from January 16 to January 22. 86-year-old Vedic scholar Laxmikant Mathuranath Dixit is expected to preside over the consecration ritual of the Ram Lalla idol at the Ram temple in Ayodhya on 22 January, marking a landmark confluence of heritage and modern relevance. He is a Varanasi native and reportedly descended from the distinguished Kashi scholar Gaga Bhatt of the 17th century who headed the coronation of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj around 350 years ago in 1674, which was a momentous occasion in Indian history that represented the creation of Hindavi Swarajya, an autonomous Maratha state.More than 40 scholars from Kashi and 121 from all branches of the Vedas throughout India are scheduled to be guided by him during the solemn idol consecration ceremonies from January 16 to January 22. The learned man responded, “It is because of the blessings bestowed on me by the legendary saints and seers of Kashi that I have been assigned the responsibility of supervising the consecration of Ram Lalla. I will perform my duties with the blessings of Lord Ram,” in an interview.The scholar’s son, Sunil Laxmikant Dixit stated that his father’s areas of expertise included yajna, consecration, Srauta which is a Sanskrit word rooted in Sruti or that which is heard and Smarta which is based on Smriti, a particular collection of Hindu literature among other rites and rituals. “My father’s study of the Vedas and rituals was under the supervision of his uncle Ganesh Dixit Javji Bhatt. He completed his studies in Shukla Yajurveda at Sangved Vidyalaya and took up teaching in the same institution. Mathuranath Dixit proclaimed, “Our roots are in Jeur village near Solapur in Maharashtra. Our ancestors moved to Kashi and dedicated their lives to the study of Hindu traditions and rituals.” Laxmikant Mathuranath Dixit and other priests are conducting a series of religious ceremonies as part of the meticulous preparation of the consecration procedures which are scheduled to begin on 16 January. These customs which culminate on 22 January when Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to carry out the rites commemorating the consecration of the Ram Lalla idol include Sarva Prayashchit homam, Dashvid Snan, Jalyatra, Tirth and Kalash Pujan as well as Kalash Yatra.Three idols of Ram Lalla are being made in Ayodhya, and the religious committee of the temple trust is tasked with picking the finest among them. The idols of Lord Ram are believed to be almost finished and are 90% concluded. The idols depict the diety’s child form. One idol is made with stone from Rajasthan and two are made from stones brought from Karnataka, the finishing touches will require around a week. Earlier, a stone was brought from Nepal, and later stones were also brought from Odisha and Maharashtra to carve the idol, but those were found not suitable. The sanctum sanctorum and the temple’s ground floor are already in a highly developed state of preparedness. Among the several ceremonies leading up to the consecration, one of the main ones on 21 January is the immersion of the idol of Ram Lalla in water from sacred rivers and well-known Hindu pilgrimage destinations which is collected in 114 urns. On 22 January in the afternoon, there will be Devpranpratishtha (consecration) rites. The idol will be brought from 8 a.m. to noon to the sanctum sanctorum. Pran-Pratishtha of Ram Lalla will be observed on 16 January and the principal rituals will be performed on 22 January by Lakshmikant Dixit.After visiting the Vice President of Vishva Hindu Parishad Champat Rai in September, the Kanchi Kamakoti Shankaracharya despatched a team of scholars, including Laxmikant Mathuranath Dixit and Acharya Ganesh Shastri Dravid to Ayodhya to determine the dates of consecration.Notable individuals who have been invited to the consecration ceremony of the Ram temple include actors Arun Govil and Dipika Chikhlia who played Lord Ram and Goddess Sita in the hit TV series ‘Ramayana,’ industrialists Mukesh Ambani, Gautam Adani and Ratan Tata, cricketers Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli, Bollywood megastar Amitabh Bachchan among other actors.Over 7,000 guests comprising 3,000 VIPs have received invites from the Ram Mandir Trust. There will also be an invitation sent to the families of the karsevaks who lost their lives in the temple movement. Further invitees consist of 4,000 seers, writers, journalists, scientists, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) president Mohan Bhagwat, yoga guru Ramdev and esteemed figures from all around the nation.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"18 December, 2023 ",‘Hamid Ansari used to help gangster Mukhtar Ansari despite being the Vice President’: BJP MLA Sushil Singh,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/hamid-ansari-used-to-help-gangster-mukhtar-despite-being-vice-president-bjp-mla-sushil-singh/,"Sushil Singh further added that Mukhtar Ansari, along with his political patrons like SP and Congress, not only got his opponents murdered, but also used to break them mentally by filing many cases against them. On 15th December (Friday), a Varanasi MP/MLA court sentenced mafia-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari to five and a half years in prison for threatening a witness in the kidnapping of the Vishva Hindu Parishad treasurer. The court also imposed a fine of Rs 10,000 on Ansari for threatening Mahavir Prasad Rungta, the brother of coal businessman and VHP treasurer Nand Kishore Rungta, who was kidnapped by Ansari’s henchman from his Varanasi office on 22nd January 1997. This was the jailed mafia’s seventh conviction since September last year. Ansari, who appeared through video conferencing, was visibly upset after hearing the ruling. Reportedly he began pleading with the judge. When Judge Ujjwal Upadhyay started pronouncing the sentence, Ansari sat with his head down and his hands on his forehead. Following this, he pleaded before the judge, saying, ‘Judge Sahab, please have mercy so that all my sentences proceed simultaneously.’ However, in the decision given by the court, it was already mentioned. Notably, Nand Kishore Rungta, a coal businessman from Jawahar Nagar of Bhelupur police station area of Varanasi, was murdered after being kidnapped on 22nd January 1997. Reports say that Nand Kishore was killed even after the family paid a ransom of Rs 1.25 crore to the kidnapper. After this, on the evening of 5th November 1997, Nand Kishore Rungta’s brother Mahavir Prasad Rungta, a witness in the case, and his family received bomb threats on his landline not to file a complaint with the police.However, the victim’s family lodged an FIR in the Bhelupur police station of Varanasi in which the court pronounced its verdict. Strikingly, in May this year, the OpIndia team visited several districts in Purvanchal that faced the severe brunt of violence at the hands of Ansari and his henchman. During the visit, OpIndia spoke with BJP MLA Sushil Singh who made several shocking claims and called Mukhtar a traitor.It is important to note that different courts have served Mukhtar Ansari with punishment ranging from 2 years to life imprisonment in different cases. At present, hearings are underway in courts for 21 out of the 65 cases registered against him. He is currently lodged in Banda jail and is being kept under strict surveillance.In May, the OpIndia team had visited various districts of Purvanchal including Varanasi, Mau, Ghazipur, and Chandauli. These districts were once badly affected by the crimes of Mukhtar Ansari. During this Purvanchal tour, the OpIndia team met Sushil Singh, BJP MLA from Chandauli’s Saidaraja Assembly.Speaking with OpIndia, BJP MLA Sushil Singh had said that Mukhtar Ansari is not only a criminal but also a traitor. He asserted that Mukhtar Ansari not only committed various crimes but also committed offenses like stealing the army’s LMG (Light Machine Gun). Notably, Ansari reportedly bought the army’s LMG (Light Machine Gun) from an Army deserter in 2004 to penetrate Krishnanand Rai’s bullet-proof SUV.BJP MLA Sushil further told OpIndia that Mukhtar and his family have been involved in crime along with politics. He said that Mukhtar continued committing crimes because no one in his family suffered untimely death as a cost of his criminal enterprise, haece he doesn’t know how it feels to pay the price of violence. BJP MLA Sushil Singh told OpIndia that Mukhtar Ansari got at least 100 of his political opponents killed. It is alleged that these murders continued unabated under the patronage of the Samajwadi Party government. According to Sushil Singh, Mukhtar Ansari primarily targeted Hindus, orchestrating plans in which Hindus killed Hindus.BJP MLA Sushil Singh added that while the Samajwadi Party shielded and advocated the crimes of Mukhtar Ansari from Lucknow, the Congress did the same and protected him from Delhi. According to Sushil Singh, the Congress Party had imposed MCOCA on Mukhtar’s entire family at the latter’s instructions.Naming the then Vice President Hamid Ansari, the BJP MLA Singh alleged that Hamid Ansari used to lobby for Mukhtar by dialing the police station. Additionally, Hamid Ansari also missed his powers to register cases at the police station against those who stood against Mukhtar.Sushil Singh further added that Mukhtar Ansari, along with his political patrons like SP and Congress, not only got his opponents murdered, but also used to break them mentally by filing many cases against them. Sushil Singh noted that even in this bad time, he got the support of Narendra Modi and Yogi Adityanath, based on which he continued his struggle against Mukhtar Ansari.Speaking with OpIndia, BJP MLA Sushil Singh became emotional. He said that his innocent uncle Satish Singh, a farmer, was also murdered by Mukhtar Ansari. According to Sushil Singh, the murder was carried out to instill fear in the minds of people. He added that the murder of Krishnanand Rai was also done by Mukhtar Ansari to create terror.Recalling the year 2004, Sushil Singh mentioned that during Manoj Sinha’s Lok Sabha election campaign in Ghazipur, he had visited the area for campaigning. He claimed that the police had surrounded him intending to harm him. After leaving, several BJP workers were apprehended, held in the police station, and subjected to torture. According to him, he survived because of God’s grace. Sushil Singh also recalled the 2009 elections when there was a contest in the Lok Sabha elections in Varanasi between BJP’s Murli Manohar Joshi and Mukhtar Ansari. At that time, Sushil Singh was an MLA from the Bahujan Samaj Party.He alleges that, at Mukhtar Ansari’s behest, Mayawati imposed numerous cases on him overnight. According to him, this was done so that Sushil Singh could be murdered in the future. He admitted that at that time he was opposing Mukhtar Ansari and supporting Murli Manohar Joshi for Hindutva.BJP MLA Sushil Singh had claimed that even though the mafia don Mukhtar Ansari has become weak due to the change of government, the roots of his crime empire are still spread across UP. Sushil Singh admitted that many victims are still hesitant to come out due to fear of Mukhtar.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

During the riot, on the 24th of February 2020, a confrontation broke out between Jaffrabad Metro Station and Maujpur Bridge. There were more than 5,000 people who came face to face in that area. The anti-CAA protestors (Islamist mob) were pelting stones and brandishing guns. When the investigation was carried out, 3 cartridges were found at the spot where Shahrukh Pathan brandished a gun, aimed at the head of a police officer in uniform. The order details how Shahrukh Pathan first fired a few rounds at the crowd and refused to pay heed to the warnings issued by the police officer. When he advanced, for the safety of the crowd, the police officer stood in his path and did not move. When Pathan was at a distance of 9-10 feet from the police officer, he fired his weapon aimed at the police officer’s head to kill him. The police officer dodged the bullet but continued to stand there in his path so he couldn’t advance further and kill the Hindus. As the police officer refused to move, Pathan pushed the officer and then aimed the gun at his head again. When the police officer issued another warning after being pushed, Shahrukh Pathan fired at the crowd and started retreating. It was only after sustained interrogation that Shahrukh Pathan revealed his full identity and confessed to his involvement in the crime. The prosecution has also argued that Shahrukh Pathan was not only attempting to kill the police officer but was also leading the mob. Interestingly, the order reveals how Shahrukh Pathan was not cooperative during the investigation and refused to reveal the identity of other rioters who were involved. During the investigation, it is detailed, that Pathan also tried his best to mislead the police. He has also displayed aggressive and remorseless conduct in jail. The prosecution argued that if let out on bail, he could potentially influence witnesses and tamper with evidence. Also, given the fear of the 10-year jail term that could be handed to him, he could abscond. Taking into account his conduct inside the jail and during the investigation, the court agreed with the prosecution and refused to grant him bail. In the order document detailing the arguments of the prosecution, there was one specific argument that deserved further investigation. The prosecution had argued that Shahrukh Pathan’s father, Sabir Ali (alias Baldev Singh) was convicted for 10 years with a fine of Rs 1 lac under Section 14 of the Foreigners Act and sections of the NDPS Act. OpIndia pulled up the court judgement in the case where Shahrukh Pathan’s father was convicted by a Delhi court. The judgement convicting him was pronounced on 11th August 2016. The facts of the case, detailed in the court order, almost read like a movie. In January 2010, Meghalaya Police filed a complaint in Delhi that three Pakistani nationals Abdul Razzaq, Mohd. Saddique and Rafakat Ali who had been brought from Lampur Seva Sadan (FRRO detention centre) on 1st January 2010 to Guru Nanak Eye Hospital for their medical examination had escaped while they were being taken back. During the investigation to track down the missing Pakistanis, the visitor’s register which was maintained by Meghalaya Police was also checked. The entries in the register made from 28/9/2009 to 02/01/2010 revealed that two people – Anees Khan and Arbaz Khan – had met Abdul Razzaq and Saleem on 29/12/2009 and 30/12/2009. During interrogation, it was revealed that before absconding on 1/1/2010, the three Pakistanis had after going to Gurunanak Eye Hospital were first taken to Jama Masjid and then one of them (Abdul Razzak) was taken by him to Seelampur near Jaffarbad to collect money from someone. Anees and Arbaz were nephews of Sabir Ali. It is pertinent to understand here that the three Pakistanis were in India illegally and therefore, were being held at a detention centre. From the story so far, it is also clear that they were given harbour at Jama Masjid from where one of them was taken to Seelampur (near Jaffrabad) to collect money – the very area where the Delhi anti-Hindu riots had broken out in February 2020 – in which Shahrukh Pathan was also leading a mob. Based on this investigation, Sabir Ali (Baldev Singh), Anees Khan and Arbaz were called to the Special Cell office and inquiries were made from them. During interrogation, it was revealed that it was Sabir Ali (Baldev Singh) who had given money to Abdul Razzaq at Seelampur before he had absconded. Essentially, from the records so far, it is clear that it was Shahrukh Pathan’s father who had give money to a Pakistani before they had absconded. This money was give to the illegal in Seelampur. The numbers that were taken from the accused during interrogation were then thoroughly investigated after those detained and questioned – including the father of Shahrukh Pathan – were set free. During the surveillance of the numbers, it was revealed that the accused – including Pathan’s father – were involved in the business of fake currency and drugs. There was also an intercepted call where Sabir Ali had spoken about the international smuggling of drugs. After this surveillance, when a notice was served to Sabir Ali, Arbaz and Anees, they refused to answer the notice served by the special cell. The Special Cell then received information about a Charas and Smack delivery that Sabir Ali and his co-accused Sannaullah Mir were about to make. When the raiding party intercepted Ali and Mir, they discovered drugs in their possession. Substantial amounts of drugs were also found on the scooter of Sabir Ali – the substance in the scooter was heroin. After the subsequent arrest, Mir and Ali were interrogated separately. During interrogation, the father of Shahrukh Pathan, Sabir Ali, confessed that he was in the business of drugs and fake currency notes along with his associates Anees, Arbaz, Jarnail and Mir. He also disclosed how the police could arrest Jarnail Singh and revealed that on an earlier occasion, Singh had given him 2 lacs and drugs, parts of which were then distributed to the others. He also agreed to lead the police to another accused – Javed. Several of the co-accused were then arrested post-interrogation of Ali. In 2011, all the accused persons were charged for the offences u/s 29 r.w.s. 21, 20 and 23 of the NDPS Act and accused Sabir Ali was separately charged for the offence u/s 21(c), 25A of the NDPS Act and accused Sanaullah Mir was separately charged for the offence of u/s 20 (b) (ii) (C) of the NDPS Act. All the accused persons were also charged for the offences u/s 489 C r.w.s. 120B IPC.In court, the prosecution examined 39 witnesses in all to prove its case against the accused. All the accused, including the father of Shahrukh Pathan, took the defence that they had been falsely implicated by the police and that no contraband/counterfeit currency notes had been recovered from their possession or at their instance at any point in time. Among all the accused, the court ‘particularly’ was intrigued by the defence of Sabir Ali alias Baldev Singh. It is pertinent to mention here that Shahrukh Pathan’s father was previously a Sikh named Baldev Singh and had converted to Islam before marrying. When Sabir Ali started explaining why he was supposedly implicated by the police, he ended up revealing his long illustrious career as a criminal. Here is what the court document said: “In particular accused Baldev Singh has stated that he originally belongs to Punjab and shifted to Delhi in 1984 due to political turmoil and terrorist activities in Punjab. In Delhi he started selling garments from a patri in Chandni Chowk but in the year 1984 the police officials of Maurice Nagar falsely arrested him on a mere suspicion that he was a terrorist. When their enquiry into his antecedents did not reveal anything incriminating against him, they planted contraband on him and falsely implicated him in a case under the Excise Act. After spending three years in the jail in the said case, he came out and started working as a driver for a transport company. During the said services a vehicle which he was driving was intercepted by DRI and contraband was recovered from the same. Though he had no knowledge and had nothing to do with the contraband concealed in the said vehicle, he was arrested by DRI and also subsequently convicted in the said case and again spent more than 10 years in judicial custody. After coming out from the jail after undergoing the sentence in the said case he again started his life afresh and started doing the business of pannis/plastics and started living with his children, his wife, his brother in law, Anees and Arbaz, the son of his second brother in law Babu Khan, in his house H.No. U­108, Gali no. 5, Arvind Nagar, Gautam Vihar, Gonda. He suspects that somebody in his locality informed the local police officials about his previous records and that is why the officials of Special Cell came to his residence in the first week of January, 2010 and forcibly picked him, his son and Anees and Arbaz and took them to PS and started inquiring about same Pakistani nationals who had absconded. Though they were released from the PS after the police officials found nothing incriminating against them, on 3/9/2010 again he, Anees and Arbaz were forcibly picked up from their residence at 1:30 a.m. in the night and brought to the office of Special cell, Rohini and falsely implicated in this case”. Essentially, Shahrukh Pathan’s father at the time had asserted that he was being falsely implicated by the police in this case of collusion with Pakistanis and being involved in an international drug peddling and fake currency racket because he had done exactly that in the past, been convicted for it, and therefore, the police thought of him as a convenient target. Further, he also dared to claim that all the previous times he was caught with contrabands and convicted, even then, he was falsely implicated. The shoddy defence that was put up by Sabir Ali was backed only by one witness – the witness’ only testimony was that he had never seen a Pakistani enter the home of Ali. This statement was made without any evidence. The court said, “The testimony of the prosecution witnesses is trustworthy and believable and nothing has emerged in their cross­examination which cast doubt on the veracity of their statement or to impeach their creditworthiness”. The court also said that all the seizure of drugs and fake currency was done per the law. While the defence tried to puncture technical holes in the process, the court threw out all of their arguments and convicted the accused – including Sabir Ali. To that effect, the court said, “as far as recovery of contraband from accused Baldev Singh and Sanaullah is concerned, in my view, the prosecution has been able to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt”. While the court rejected the argument that the accused were colluding with each other, it convicted all accused for the possession of contraband substances, however, there was amply evidence of collusion as well based on the statements of Ali. Based on this evidence, Sabir Ali, the father of Shahrukh Pathan, was sentenced to 10 years in prison and 1 lac fine in 2016. According to reports, Shahrukh’s mother also is said to be a notorious drug peddler.In his show ‘Prime Time’ on 26th February 2020, Ravish Kumar resorted to spreading half-truths and full lies about the horrifying spate of violence that had engulfed the national capital. In pursuance of what appeared as his agenda to tarnish Hindus and portray them as the aggressors of the riots, Kumar identified Mohammad Shahrukh alias Shahrukh Pathan, who fired at Delhi Police personnel on February 24, as one ‘Anurag Mishra’. For the 26th February show, Ravish claimed that police had not yet arrested him while he was arrested on 25th February itself, good 24 hours before his show premiered. “Police ki haalat yeh hai ki abhi tak giraftar nahin hua hai. Police saaf kehti hai ki Shahrukh hai magar aap social media mein dekhiye Anurag Mishra bataya jaa raha hai. (Situation of the Police is such that they have not yet arrested him. Police says his name is Shahrukh but if you see on social media, he is called Anurag Mishra),” he spoke in his characteristic drawl during the show. Naturally, it was quite a revelation since no one had yet referred to the shooter as “Anurag Mishra” till then.He then asked Delhi Police to speak out on his identity again. He then played an undated speech of his reporter who appeared to be asking Delhi Police personnel about Shahrukh’s arrest. Slyly, Ravish Kumar then played the videos of BJP leaders Anurag Thakur, Kapil Mishra and Pravesh Verma addressing rallies ahead of Delhi elections to cast aspersions that their speeches were responsible for stoking riots a month later. Further, in August 2021, 18 months after the 25-year-old Delhi anti-Hindu riots accused Shahrukh Pathan was arrested for brandishing a gun at the police and threatening them, The Quint published a white paper on him watering down his crime and making him appear like a cherubic saint. The Quint started by describing his menacing march as ‘brazen confidence in his gait’. Then the writer of the ‘Shahrukh Pathan fan page’ romanticised his criminal act. “Unfazed by the policemen in riot gear, he shot bullets in the air while media persons captured his acts in astonishment. The fact that the gym enthusiast, who was also a local, did not wear a mask to hide his identity, made his ‘bravado’ seem peculiar and odd,” the author wrote. The Quint then went on to explain how his friends described Shahrukh as someone who was into grooming and was interested in his appearance. He was characterised as someone who was a biryani-lover, liked to put gel in his hair, blow dry it, wear crisp, ironed shirts, good shoes and well, make TikTok videos. The author interviewed Pathan’s mother, who had glowing views about her son. She said her son was innocent and ‘simple-minded’.Shahrukh’s mother also highlighted counterfactual scenarios to water down her son’s criminality. She told his fans at The Quint that she often wonders, “What if she had given him food when he asked? What if the timing was a few minutes before or after namaz?” Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

"15 December, 2023 ","‘They came in a vehicle with no number plates, set fire on Bittu Bajrangi’s brother’: Arman had earlier burned his own shop to blame...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/bittu-bajrangis-brother-set-on-fire-arman-had-earlier-burned-his-own-shop-to-blame-hindus-says-activist/,"Bittu Bajrangi said that during the Nuh riots, Armaan used to sell juice in Faridabad. He had set his own shop on fire and had tried to blame local Hindus for it. However, his lie was caught during the police investigation.On Wednesday (December 13th) Hindu activist Bittu Bajrangi’s family was targeted and attackers attempted to burn his brother Mahesh Panchal alive by pouring thinner on him in the Dabua Colony in Haryana’s Faridabad. Within hours, victim Mahesh Panchal was transferred from three hospitals while in a critical condition. Mahesh has sustained severe burn injuries, estimated to be around 60%, and he is in critical condition. The next 72 hours, according to the doctors, will be crucial for the victim.As per the information received, the assailants who burned Mahesh first attempted to capture and burn him, but they were unsuccessful. Subsequently, they poured thinner on Mahesh and set him ablaze. Following this, the accused escaped. Mahesh dived into a drain right away, but the fire was not extinguished. He then took 3-4 dips, and the fire was quenched. After that, he walked to his house, which was around 800 metres away on his own as nobody came forward to help him. When finally Mahesh somehow reached his home, Bittu Bajrangi took him the the hospital. According to media reports, the attackers led by one Armaan first confirmed Bittu Bajrangi’s brother Mahesh Panchal’s identity. ‘Are you the brother of Bittu Bajrangi?’ they questioned Mahesh Panchal. When Mahesh said yes to this question, they poured thinner on him and set him ablaze.Arman Khan, the main accused in this case, has been arrested by police and is being interrogated. Meanwhile, the police have examined the crime scene. According to the report, the white WagonR used by the attackers had no registration number. Moreover, two bikes had followed him suspiciously to the location.Meanwhile, Bittu Bajrangi stated that Mahesh has been moved around three hospitals so far. First, it was the government hospital, then it was Santosh Hospital, and now it is Prachi Hospital. The doctors have said that the next 72 hours will be critical. Several members of Hindu organisations and local BJP MLAs visited the hospital to inquire about Mahesh’s well-being.Bittu Bajrangi said that during the Nuh riots, Armaan used to sell juice in Faridabad. He had set his own shop on fire and had tried to blame local Hindus for it. However, his lie was caught during the police investigation.Bittu Bajrangi further stated that he had been receiving death threats for a long with those behind the threats asking him to “take his slippers back (Chappal lekar jao)”. The code ‘chappal’ was used by the perpetrators to remind Bajrangi about the slippers Hindus had left outside the temple when the Islamist mob attacked them during Nuh violence earlier this year.Bittu alleged that the attackers who attempted to kill his brother were all involved in the July 31 violence unleashed by Islamists in Haryana’s Nuh district. Bittu Bajrangi stated that the family sought an arms licence, but the administration refused. Not only that, but Bittu said, citing a police officer, that the person who issued the threats had also threatened a prominent Gurgaon businessman for ‘protection money’ adding that he is a seasoned criminal.Meanwhile, an OpIndia team arrived on the scene and found several police personnel stationed at the hospital. Several members of Hindu organisations also convened at the hospital. However, no one is permitted to meet with the victim. The police have imposed multiple sections in this case, including sections 147, 149, 307, and 326A. Arman, the accused, is being questioned by local police.Bittu Bajrangi told OpIndia that he is satisfied with the actions taken by the Faridabad Police in the matter so far. He has also urged people to refrain from engaging in any form of protest or unlawful activity.Bittu Bajrangi is a Hindu activist who raises his voice for the unity of Hindus. After the violence that erupted in Nuh in the Mewat region, his name gained more traction in the news. Subsequently, he was also arrested in a case of a clash with the police. At present, Bittu Bajrangi is out of jail on bail. In this case, all Hindu organisations supported him. Initially, the rumour spread rapidly that Bittu Bajrangi was associated with the Nuh violence, but the police made it clear that action was taken against Bittu Bajrangi not related to the Nuh violence, but in a different case of a clash with the police.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"18 December, 2023 ","Putin listening to everything going on in Ukraine during the war? Ukraine military chief’s office bugged, devices found",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/ukraine-military-chief-says-one-of-his-offices-were-bugged-devices-found/,"Ukrainian Army Chief Valeriy Zaluzhnyi said, “I have several offices where I work. This happened in one of them. We checked (the room) and found (the device)."" On 18th December (Monday), Ukraine’s military chief claimed that a covert listening device was found in one of the offices where he works. He also alluded that more such devices were also found in other places as well without going into the details. Ukrainian Army Chief Valeriy Zaluzhnyi said, “I have several offices where I work. This happened in one of them. We checked (the room) and found (the device).” He added that listening devices were not only found in the office where he worked but he didn’t provide further details. However, he did not clarify whether more than one device was discovered within the premises of the Ukraine General Staff.As per Ukrainian local media, the bugs were found on Saturday (16th December) before the beginning of the working day. According to Ukraine’s security service, the bugs were found during a routine sweep of the room that the official was using. However, it added that the device wasn’t working. Following the revelation, Ukrainian media reported that suspicions immediately pointed toward Russia amid the continuing war between the two nations, which could drag into another year. According to Reuters, Ukraine’s security service said on Sunday (17th December) that it had launched a criminal probe under a law on information gathering after a “technical device” was found in an office that could have been used in the future by Commander in Chief Valery Zaluzhnyi.On the Telegram messaging app, the agency said that an investigation had been opened under an article in Ukraine’s criminal code on “unlawful acquisition, sale, or use of special technical means for obtaining information”.The statement further indicated that the device, initially identified as a bug by local media, was preliminarily assessed to be “non-operational,” and no methods of storing information or remotely transmitting audio recordings were detected.It said, “We emphasise that the device was found not directly in Valery Zaluzhnyi’s office but in one of the premises that could have been used by him in the future for work.”Meanwhile, several Ukrainian and Western media reports claim that there has been friction between Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky and Army Commander-in-chief Valery Zaluzhny. In an article for The Economist, Zaluzhny conceded that the conflict in Ukraine has come to a standstill. In a subsequent interview with the same magazine, he expressed that Ukrainian troops would not be able to make advancements along the engagement line.Following his observations, the Ukrainian presidential office expressed disagreement with Zaluzhny’s statements.  Strana media outlet reported that Zaluzhny’s comments might indicate his presidential ambitions. Ukrainian media also speculate about the potential resignation of Zaluzhny.Ukraine and Russia have been at war for more than a year now. In 2014, Russia captured Crimea from Ukraine and has been controlling it ever since. The war started after Russia felt provoked by Ukraine’s inclination to join NATO which is largely an anti-Russia coalition of Western nations. Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 and the battle is being fought on Ukrainian soil. Ukraine has received immense support from the West but the support is gradually fading. Ukraine has seen massive losses in men and territory.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

"18 December, 2023 ","Congress kickstarts ‘Donate for Desh’ campaign, forgets to register the domains for the campaign ",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/congress-kickstarts-donate-for-desh-campaign-forgets-to-register-the-domains-for-the-campaign/,"While Congress launched its crowdfunding campaign 'Donate for Desh' without registering a domain name for the same, BJP and OpIndia acquired domain names that redirected Congress recently announced its crowdfunding campaign ‘Donate for Desh’ to raise funds from the general public following reports of massive seizures of unaccounted cash from Congress leaders. Days after the announcement, Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge on 18th December launched the campaign in New Delhi. Incidentally, the links for the Congress crowdfunding campaign land the donors on BJP’s donation page. It has come to light that the funds and donations through the Congress party’s campaign are adding to the Bharatiya Janata Party’s coffers. As per reports, the grand old party kicked off the crowdfunding campaign without registering the related domain names. Reports add that the BJP secured the website domains after Congress failed to register the relevant domains for the donation websites promoted in its fundraising campaign.The links redirected the donors to BJP and OPIndia’s donation pages. Simply put, when a person opens the Donatefordesh.org website, the user is redirected to BJP’s donation page which seeks details like donors’ name, mobile number, and email ID.Congress launches #DonateForDesh campaign but fails to book important domain. BJP bought it & redirected it on their website Check out 👉 https://t.co/EzdIREg5YC pic.twitter.com/uiWRqOhU4qSimilarly Donatefordesh.com and Donatefordesh.in take the user to the OpIndia Support pages. 😭😂😂 pic.twitter.com/3gkO2fpSVBCongress launched #DonateForDesh campaign.But it failed to book important domain names.So,BJP bought https://t.co/F3NcbFxDZc 😛Now after the campaign,@RahulGandhi will blame Adani for the donations happened to BJP 😂 pic.twitter.com/TyQh5cbvnYFollowing the goof-up in crowdfunding, netizens have been taking a jibe at the Congress party calling it the grand old party’s moye-moye moment. Netizens have slammed Congress asking the grand old party if it didn’t have any domain for these websites why it kicked off the campaign prematurely. I have been dealing in domains and hosting since 2003. It has been over 20 years. I have never seen someone so irresponsible as @INCIndia, who started a nationwide campaign by the name ""#DonateForDesh"" but forgot to register TLDs, including .com and .org. Check the domains below…Several users called it a major failure of the IT department of Congress party. According to several Twitter users, the failure alludes to the callous or non-serious approach of the party for its own crowdfunding campaign as otherwise, it had enough time and resources to run basic errands.I mean by their own admission, idiots had 2 days to book at least the .org or .in domain name, but they didn't. Has Congress got ""Donate for Desh"" as a trademark? If their alliance called be called INDIA, we can ask money too for DonateForDesh https://t.co/eXPfnV1VNoPlease don’t blame Shrieking Jane for the fiasco of Congress’s ‘Donate for Desh’ fraud. She has to not only appear less intelligent than Rahul Gandhi but also prove it. 😂Let alone domains, the Congress didn’t even block SM accounts. Check out @donatefordesh, for instance.और…However, it’s not that Congress hasn’t received donations in the last few years. In 2021-22, the party received donations totaling ₹95 crore through electoral bonds. Additionally, in September 2023, the Congress announced that it possesses assets worth about ₹700 crores.Nonetheless, the Congress party will be collecting donations both online and offline. On December 28, 2023, the party is celebrating its 138th anniversary. In alignment with that, it has issued an appeal to its supporters to contribute in multiples of ₹138, while urging its district and state-level workers to donate ₹1380.The campaign has been initiated by its president, Mallikarjun Kharge, who has donated ₹1.38 lakh to the party. Congress will conduct this campaign online until December 28, 2023, following which its workers will go door-to-door to collect donations. However, the crowdfunding campaign has been marred with a major setback and failure for the party’s IT department as it lost the race for website domains to BJP and OpIndia. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"18 December, 2023 ","Rise in tourist footfall, international airport, Vande Bharat Express: How Ram Mandir is becoming the development centre for Ayodhya",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/rise-in-tourist-footfall-international-airport-vande-bharat-express-how-ram-mandir-is-becoming-the-development-centre-for-ayodhya/,"The unquestionable devotion of billions of Hindus towards Shri Ram is not lost on anyone. Ayodhya is expected to be thronged with tourists after the Ram Mandir inauguration. It is in this divine backdrop that the city is witnessing large-scale, fast-paced development like never before.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is on a 2-day tour to his Lok Sabha constituency of Varanasi. Among other programmes, the Prime Minister inaugurated the Swarved Mahamandir in the holy city. The temple is dedicated to Swarved, a Hindu Spritual Scripture authored by Sadguru Shri Sadafal Deoji Maharaj, the founder of Vihangam Yoga.Speaking about the confluence of divinity and development, PM Modi said that it is around India’s spiritual structure that India’s craft and art touched unimaginable heights.“New pathways of knowledge and research emerged from here; unlimited possibilities related to enterprises and industries took birth here and it is from here that constant flow of humanitarian values emerged for the world,” PM Modi said.PM Modi highlighted that the tyrants who ruled over India first targeted our symbols. “The revival of these cultural symbols post-Independence was important. Had we respected our cultural identity, then the feeling of unity and self-respect would have been strong in the country. But this is not what happened. The restoration of Somnath Temple post-Independence was opposed,” he said.This premise of the Modi government’s policy of development in the holy cities of Kashi linked with spirituality has given a much-needed impetus to the people-led campaign of revival of the lost symbols of Hindu civilisation.The upcoming inauguration of the Ayodhya Ram Mandir and Pran Pratishtha of Ram Lalla on 22nd January 2024 is a fine example of the same. The unquestionable devotion of billions of Hindus towards Shri Ram is not lost on anyone. Ayodhya is expected to be thronged with tourists after the Ram Mandir inauguration.The temple itself is built on a 2.7 acres area with 12 gates and 3 floors. As per reports, the tourist footfall expected in Ayodhya by 2051 is a staggering three lakh people per day. In 2021, 1.57 crore tourists had visited the holy city.This number rose to more than 2.39 crore domestic tourists in 2022 and 1,465 foreign tourists. This brings numbers of visitors to nearly 4 crore in 2021-22. Reports said this figure is estimated to touch 8 to 10 crores after the temple opens in January 2024.Clearly, such devotion merits development for the convenient travel of devotees and pilgrims to the holy city. The Ayodhya International Airport is soon to be open to travelers.Maryada Purshottam Shri Ram International Airport will witness its inaugural flight reportedly on 30th December from the national capital to Ayodhya whereas regular flights will begin from 6th January.Vande Bharat trains will now also connect Ayodhya to the national capital, Varanasi and to Sitamarhi in Bihar. This circuit connecting through the Vande Bharat makes journey for pilgrims to the revered cities easier in terms of time and money too.Another key highlight is the Ramayana Circuit (or Ram Circuit) which aims to connect major pilgrim sites in India and Nepal linked to the Ramayana. This thematic circuit is identified under the Swadesh Darshan scheme of Ministry of Tourism.The city has seen whopping investments in real estate too. A Mumbai-based real estate company The House of Abhinandan Lodha has invested nearly ₹300 crore in acquiring a 25-acre land parcel in Ayodhya and has laid out a plan to launch a plotted development project in January 2024.The project is situated approximately 12 to 15 minutes from the Shri Ram Temple. According to Samujjwal Ghosh, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), HOABL, the company expects to invest roughly 1200 crore over three to four years that is by December 2026.CP Kukreja Architects and L&T submitted their master blueprint plan for Ayodhya in January 2022. The firms have identified more than 40 tourism spots and development of the same is being done in phases.The project includes development of public amenities, street furniture, broadening and “pedestrianisation” of roads along with redevelopment of Saryu riverfront.“A tourism facilitation centre with 115 keys and six Dharamshalas that can accommodate 7200 beds have been proposed along with international museums that highlight the city’s rich cultural heritage,” ET quoted Dikshu C Kukreja, managing principal, at CP Kukreja Architects.Add to that a solar city near the Saryu River, ferries, luxury river cruise, houseboats are only some of the many tourism-boosters to attract visitors and pilgrims alike. All this made possible with one grand temple.Varanasi, a city of lights and temples, is witnessing the same gush of development. “The work that began with Somnath (restoration of Somnath Temple) has become a movement today,” PM said in his address on Monday (18th December).Since the inauguration of the Kashi Vishwanath Dham, a record 12.0 crore devotees have visited in just two years of the development of the temple corridor. This number is expected to cross 13 crore soon.Subsequently, facilities for tourists and devotees have increased. Notably, earlier, the temple premises had an area of only 3000 square feet. It was enlarged in 2021 to about 5 lakh square feet. This has allowed a capacity of 50,000 – 75,000 devotees in the temple premises.The temple drew 7.35 million devotees within a year of the development of the corridor. Varanasi’s tourist footfall was eight times that of Goa in 2022.In fact, after Kashi, other holy cities in U.P. including Mathura, Ayodhya, and Prayagraj had more tourists than Goa in 2022, indicating a massive increase in spiritual tourism of India’s ancient holy cities.In this backdrop, PM Modi on Monday laid the foundation stone of development projects worth over Rs 19,150 crores in Baba Kashinath’s city. Being a representative of the Kashi constituency, PM Modi has used his position of power to keep his constituency in the headlines too.This was his second visit to Varanasi in four months, the last one being in September. The fast-paced development in the holy cities of Ayodhya and Kashi and beyond aim to make the pilgrimage sites as the centre for growth and development across the country.The confluence of divinity and development is sure to boost both, the cultural and economical strength of India and also bring back India’s lost heritage to life.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"18 December, 2023 ",Arvind Kejriwal summoned by Enforcement Directorate (ED) in Delhi liquor policy scam case,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/arvind-kejriwal-summoned-enforcement-directorate-liquor-policy-scam/,"Arvind Kejriwal was summoned by the financial watchdog to appear before it on 2nd November as well. The head of the Aam Aadmi Party, however, had ignored the summonsChief Minister of Delhi, Arvind Kejriwal, was summoned by the Enforcement Directorate to be questioned regarding the money laundering case related to the Delhi excise policy that was scrapped. On Thursday, December 21, he has been asked to appear before the agency. Arvind Kejriwal has received two summons from the Enforcement Directorate over the same case.Arvind Kejriwal was summoned by the financial watchdog to appear before it on 2nd November as well. The head of the Aam Aadmi Party, however, had ignored the summons, claiming it was unlawful and intended for political purposes.Manish Sisodia and Sanjay Singh, two of Arvind Kejriwal’s party leaders, were both taken into custody by the central investigative agencies concerning the same case. In April of this year, the CBI also questioned Arvind Kejriwal regarding the purported liquor scam.After being questioned for more than nine hours at the CBI headquarters in Delhi, Arvind Kejriwal spoke to the media and said the investigation team had asked him 56 questions. “CBI questioning was conducted for 9.5 hours. I answered all the questions. The entire alleged liquor scam is false and bad politics. AAP is ‘kattar imaandaar party’. They want to finish AAP but the country’s people are with us,” Kejriwal had said.It may be noted that Kejriwal was summoned by the federal agency to appear before it on November 2. However, the CM skipped the summons and left for Madhya Pradesh later in the day to hold a roadshow in Singrauli.Terming the summons ‘illegal’, Kejriwal responded to the summons by ED by saying that he would not be appearing for the questioning as he had other events scheduled. He had claimed that he is a star campaigner with state elections coming up and therefore, he has other commitments which would not allow him to attend the summons.Arvind Kejriwal also added that the summons was “motivated and issued for extraneous considerations” and asked ED to withdraw it. The case against the Aam Aadmi Party in the Delhi Liquor scam became stronger after the Supreme Court denied bail to AAP leader and former deputy CM of Delhi Manish Sisodia. While denying bail, the apex court noted that a money trail of Rs 338 crore has been tentatively established in the case.The liquor policy for 2021-22 was put into effect by the Delhi administration on 17th November 2021, however, it was cancelled at the end of September 2022 due to accusations of corruption. According to the agencies, the new regulation led to monopolisation and gave economic advantages to people who weren’t eligible for liquor licenses.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"18 December, 2023 ",Gyanvapi survey: ASI files sealed report in Varanasi court regarding the survey of the controversial site,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/asi-varanasi-court-gyanvapi-site-controversial/,"The ASI was instructed to undertake scientific investigation at the property in question, i.e. settlement plot number 9130 (Gyanvapi site), by District and Sessions Judge AK VishveshaOn Monday (18th December), the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) submitted its report on a scientific survey it had undertaken at the controversial Gyanvapi complex. The report was submitted after the Varanasi court had ordered ASI to ascertain whether the disputed mosque was constructed over a pre-existing structure of a Hindu temple.“We submitted the report in a sealed cover in the court today. The court has fixed December 21 as the next date to look into the report,” said advocate Amit Srivastava, representing the ASI, in Varanasi. The report will be shared with the petitioners on December 21.During the 12th December hearing, the ASI had requested an extra week to submit the report, citing Superintending Archaeologist Avinash Mohanty’s risein blood pressure. The court had then given the ASI an extension to submit its survey report for the eighth time.A scientific examination of the controversial complex was mandated by the Varanasi court on July 21 to determine whether the mosque was “constructed over a pre-existing structure of a Hindu temple.”The ASI was instructed to undertake scientific investigation at the property in question, i.e. settlement plot number 9130 (Gyanvapi site), by District and Sessions Judge AK Vishvesha. The survey was to exclude the ‘Wazukhana’ area, which was sealed on the Supreme Court’s order. The mosque committee, however, sought a stay on the survey from the Allahabad High Court and then the Supreme Court. The survey was resumed on 4th August under security arrangements after both courts cleared the way.The ASI asked the court for more time to finish the survey after the allotted time had passed. “In compliance with the said order, the ASI is conducting a scientific investigation/survey at the site,” the ASI stated in its request asking for an extension of time.Additionally, the ASI stated that a team of experts from the Geophysical Research Institute, Hyderabad, is also conducting a GPR (ground-penetrating radar) survey and that acquired data is being analysed and studied.The application stated that a large amount of debris has been discovered covering the original features of the structure in the mosque’s cellars. “Cleaning of this trash/debris etc above the working floor level is in progress to examine the structures scientifically. As the court has directed (the ASI) to conduct a survey beneath the grounds of all the cellars, it is necessary that soil/debris dumped or accumulated there is removed without causing any damage to the standing structure,” read the application. “The debris is being removed very carefully and systematically, which is a slow process and going to take some more time before the ground of all the cellars is cleared for the survey,” the application added. The Anjuman Intezamia Masjid Committee, which had previously requested that the survey of the controversial mosque complex be halted, objected to giving the ASI more time.In its response, the ASI stated that it was following the orders of the high court and the Supreme Court and that all precautions were being taken during the survey to ensure that the structure was not damaged.The court also directed the ASI that the orders of the high court and the Supreme Court be complied with during the survey. In August, the Varanasi High Court ordered the ASI and other stakeholders not to share information about the Gyanvapi site complex survey with anyone, especially the media. Apart from the ASI, the other parties involved in the case are the Anjuman Intezamia Masjid Committee and the Hindu petitioners, as well as their representatives and the government counsel.Last month, the ASI informed the court that it had completed a scientific survey at the site but that the ground-penetrating radar survey report was still being prepared, and that it would need more time to submit the survey report.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"18 December, 2023 ","After banning animal sacrifice at Shyama Mai Temple, the next target may be Maa Kali’s narmund mala: How this Sanatana tradition differs from Bakrid",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/animal-sacrifice-at-shyama-mai-temple-how-this-sanatana-tradition-differs-from-bakrid/,"The devotees have questioned the intentions of the state government as the ban on Pashubali is being seen as tying the hands of the devotees who have faith in Shyama Mai and have been sacrificing animals for generations.The Bihar government has announced a ban on the practice of Pashubali (animal sacrifice) in the Shyama Mai Temple of Darbanga. The decision of the Bihar Government has angered the Hindu devotees. The Bihar State Religious Trust Council, chaired by Akhilesh Kumar Jain, imposed the ban. Jain was previously Law Secretary. Hindus have started agitation against the decision, demanding his resignation. They also burnt his effigy. Devotees are saying that Hindu traditions are being played with. They questioned why the state government is interfering in the practice that has been going on since ancient times in the temple.Currently, the Bihar government is being run by the alliance of JDU, RJD and Congress headed by Nitish Kumar. Tejashwi Yadav is the deputy CM of the state. Following the state government’s decision, several Hindu organizations, including Bajrang Dal, have imposed the decision. Notably, all parties ruling the state government oppose the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). While the BJP is vocal on Hindutva issues, the state government’s decision is being seen as against Hindu tradition. The devotees have questioned the intentions of the state government as the ban on Pashubali is being seen as tying the hands of the devotees who have faith in Shyama Mai and have been sacrificing animals for generations.Notably, the Shyama Mai Temple is on the funeral pyre of Maharaj Rameshwar Singh of Darbhanga. Raja Rameshwar Singh was a devotee of Kali Maa and practised Tantra Sidhi. This is why the temple is also called Rameshwari Mai Temple. The temple was constructed in 1933 by his son Kameshwar Singh. Talking about the temple’s sanctum sanctorum, Mahakal is installed on the right side of the idol of Maa Kali and Ganapati and Batukbhairav are installed on the left side.The Mundamala around the neck of Maa Kali has the same number of Narmunds as the number of letters in the Hindi alphabet. The Hindi alphabet is also considered a symbol of creation. Special events are being organized here during Navratri. Devi Maa is worshipped here in both Vedic and Tantric processes. In ‘Rameshwar Charit Mithila Ramayana’, Laldas, the servant of Maharaj, also describes Shyama Mai as the form of Mata Sita. In this story, Lord Ram was hit by an arrow from the demon Sahastranand, after which the angry Mata Sita’s complexion turned black, and her tongue came out.This form of her was called Shyama Mai. It is said that Lord Shiva himself had to come to calm his anger. There are two things worth noting here – first, it is a Shakta temple, a place of goddess worship. Secondly, Tantra Sadhana has also been taking place in the temple since the beginning. Both of these are part of the Sanatan Hindu tradition. Animal sacrifices are made in Tantra Sadhna practices.Bihar State Religious Trust Council has banned the practice of sacrifice, citing the Cruelty to Animals Act. The protesters have decided that hundreds of people will gather and sacrifice animals in the temple premises as a mark of non-cooperation with this order of the state government.This is not the first time a government has banned Pashubali. In October-November 2020, an FIR was registered against those who sacrificed animals in the Durga temple of Kamathi in Nagpur, Maharashtra. In Kerala, animal sacrifice was banned by making a law.Speaking to OpIndia, Mohit Bhardwaj, founder of ‘Vedic India’ and an expert on Hindu traditions, said that animal sacrifice is allowed in the Hindu religion but with many rules and restrictions. He said that in the Hindu religion, many communities offer animals as food to the deity. He gave the example of Shrauta and Grihya Sutras, in which animal sacrifice is permitted. Suchitra Samanta said in a research paper published in the ‘Association for Asian Studies’ that animal sacrifice is allowed in many Tantras and Puranas.In the Hindu religion, there are provisions for offering meat and vegetables as food to the Gods and Goddesses. Animal sacrifice has special importance in Goddess worship. For example, meat is also offered as Prasad to the Goddess in Bengal during Navratri. Animal sacrifice is common there, as it is part of the Shakta tradition. Since ancient times, animal sacrifice has been done in the worship of Shakti and Tantra Sadhana.Notably, the forest dweller community, which is part of Hinduism, offers meat as Prasad to the Gods and Goddesses as part of their daily routine. However, the “secular” law of India has stopped it. On the other hand, if someone kills an animal to eat meat, it is justified. It is evident that the religious traditions of only one community are being disrespected and stopped.If the government wants to ban animal sacrifice, they should not allow such practices on Bakrid as well, where rivers of blood flow. Not to forget, Muslims follow the ‘Halal’ way of killing animals, where they are tortured and killed slowly. Interestingly, no one sees animal cruelty in that practice. Since there is unity in Muslim society, the political parties have to follow the path of appeasement, and they often avoid meddling with their traditions.However, when it comes to Hindus, the governments become the contractors of the religion. It is a fact that the Islamic way of killing animals is barbaric. However, it should be the basis for the government or courts’ decisions regarding Hindu traditions. Hindu society needs to wake up and pay attention to preserve its traditions. The government has no right to ban animal sacrifice.दरभंगा श्यामा माई मंदिर में बलि प्रदान पर रोक से लोगों में आक्रोश। pic.twitter.com/KV7GjBmyPyThe Supreme Court had allowed women to worship at the Sabarimala Temple in Kerala based on a petition filed by activists with no faith in Hinduism. Misinformation was spread about the temple, and it was anti-women. Girls and elderly women are allowed to worship in Sabarimala Temple. On the other hand, the government or judiciary do not decide who will enter a mosque and who will not.The Hindu religion will operate as decided by the traditions of the temples, scriptures, history, and opinions of the Hindu scholars, not by the government or the court. Sanatan Dharma has seen several changes since it came into existence. Some practices were added, and some were removed, but society did them. At that time, courts and governments did not exist in their present form. After a few days, the government may come and say that Maa Kali should not wear Narmund and it should be removed as it promotes violence. Will Hindus accept it?Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources. We need your support to fight them.

"18 December, 2023 ",‘Hamid Ansari used to help gangster Mukhtar Ansari despite being the Vice President’: BJP MLA Sushil Singh,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/hamid-ansari-used-to-help-gangster-mukhtar-despite-being-vice-president-bjp-mla-sushil-singh/,"Sushil Singh further added that Mukhtar Ansari, along with his political patrons like SP and Congress, not only got his opponents murdered, but also used to break them mentally by filing many cases against them. On 15th December (Friday), a Varanasi MP/MLA court sentenced mafia-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari to five and a half years in prison for threatening a witness in the kidnapping of the Vishva Hindu Parishad treasurer. The court also imposed a fine of Rs 10,000 on Ansari for threatening Mahavir Prasad Rungta, the brother of coal businessman and VHP treasurer Nand Kishore Rungta, who was kidnapped by Ansari’s henchman from his Varanasi office on 22nd January 1997. This was the jailed mafia’s seventh conviction since September last year. Ansari, who appeared through video conferencing, was visibly upset after hearing the ruling. Reportedly he began pleading with the judge. When Judge Ujjwal Upadhyay started pronouncing the sentence, Ansari sat with his head down and his hands on his forehead. Following this, he pleaded before the judge, saying, ‘Judge Sahab, please have mercy so that all my sentences proceed simultaneously.’ However, in the decision given by the court, it was already mentioned. Notably, Nand Kishore Rungta, a coal businessman from Jawahar Nagar of Bhelupur police station area of Varanasi, was murdered after being kidnapped on 22nd January 1997. Reports say that Nand Kishore was killed even after the family paid a ransom of Rs 1.25 crore to the kidnapper. After this, on the evening of 5th November 1997, Nand Kishore Rungta’s brother Mahavir Prasad Rungta, a witness in the case, and his family received bomb threats on his landline not to file a complaint with the police.However, the victim’s family lodged an FIR in the Bhelupur police station of Varanasi in which the court pronounced its verdict. Strikingly, in May this year, the OpIndia team visited several districts in Purvanchal that faced the severe brunt of violence at the hands of Ansari and his henchman. During the visit, OpIndia spoke with BJP MLA Sushil Singh who made several shocking claims and called Mukhtar a traitor.It is important to note that different courts have served Mukhtar Ansari with punishment ranging from 2 years to life imprisonment in different cases. At present, hearings are underway in courts for 21 out of the 65 cases registered against him. He is currently lodged in Banda jail and is being kept under strict surveillance.In May, the OpIndia team had visited various districts of Purvanchal including Varanasi, Mau, Ghazipur, and Chandauli. These districts were once badly affected by the crimes of Mukhtar Ansari. During this Purvanchal tour, the OpIndia team met Sushil Singh, BJP MLA from Chandauli’s Saidaraja Assembly.Speaking with OpIndia, BJP MLA Sushil Singh had said that Mukhtar Ansari is not only a criminal but also a traitor. He asserted that Mukhtar Ansari not only committed various crimes but also committed offenses like stealing the army’s LMG (Light Machine Gun). Notably, Ansari reportedly bought the army’s LMG (Light Machine Gun) from an Army deserter in 2004 to penetrate Krishnanand Rai’s bullet-proof SUV.BJP MLA Sushil further told OpIndia that Mukhtar and his family have been involved in crime along with politics. He said that Mukhtar continued committing crimes because no one in his family suffered untimely death as a cost of his criminal enterprise, haece he doesn’t know how it feels to pay the price of violence. BJP MLA Sushil Singh told OpIndia that Mukhtar Ansari got at least 100 of his political opponents killed. It is alleged that these murders continued unabated under the patronage of the Samajwadi Party government. According to Sushil Singh, Mukhtar Ansari primarily targeted Hindus, orchestrating plans in which Hindus killed Hindus.BJP MLA Sushil Singh added that while the Samajwadi Party shielded and advocated the crimes of Mukhtar Ansari from Lucknow, the Congress did the same and protected him from Delhi. According to Sushil Singh, the Congress Party had imposed MCOCA on Mukhtar’s entire family at the latter’s instructions.Naming the then Vice President Hamid Ansari, the BJP MLA Singh alleged that Hamid Ansari used to lobby for Mukhtar by dialing the police station. Additionally, Hamid Ansari also missed his powers to register cases at the police station against those who stood against Mukhtar.Sushil Singh further added that Mukhtar Ansari, along with his political patrons like SP and Congress, not only got his opponents murdered, but also used to break them mentally by filing many cases against them. Sushil Singh noted that even in this bad time, he got the support of Narendra Modi and Yogi Adityanath, based on which he continued his struggle against Mukhtar Ansari.Speaking with OpIndia, BJP MLA Sushil Singh became emotional. He said that his innocent uncle Satish Singh, a farmer, was also murdered by Mukhtar Ansari. According to Sushil Singh, the murder was carried out to instill fear in the minds of people. He added that the murder of Krishnanand Rai was also done by Mukhtar Ansari to create terror.Recalling the year 2004, Sushil Singh mentioned that during Manoj Sinha’s Lok Sabha election campaign in Ghazipur, he had visited the area for campaigning. He claimed that the police had surrounded him intending to harm him. After leaving, several BJP workers were apprehended, held in the police station, and subjected to torture. According to him, he survived because of God’s grace. Sushil Singh also recalled the 2009 elections when there was a contest in the Lok Sabha elections in Varanasi between BJP’s Murli Manohar Joshi and Mukhtar Ansari. At that time, Sushil Singh was an MLA from the Bahujan Samaj Party.He alleges that, at Mukhtar Ansari’s behest, Mayawati imposed numerous cases on him overnight. According to him, this was done so that Sushil Singh could be murdered in the future. He admitted that at that time he was opposing Mukhtar Ansari and supporting Murli Manohar Joshi for Hindutva.BJP MLA Sushil Singh had claimed that even though the mafia don Mukhtar Ansari has become weak due to the change of government, the roots of his crime empire are still spread across UP. Sushil Singh admitted that many victims are still hesitant to come out due to fear of Mukhtar.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"18 December, 2023 ",‘Bali tradition is practiced since ancient times’: Giriraj Singh asks if restrictions on sacrifices at Shyama Mai temple extend to Bakrid,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/hindus-should-stop-consuming-halal-meat-uni-giriraj-singh-after-bihar-bans-sacrifices-at-shyama-mai-temple/,"""I admire the Muslims who make it a point to consume only halal meat. Now Hindus should demonstrate a similar commitment to their own religious tradition,"" Singh said.The Bihar State Religious Trust Council has issued a directive prohibiting offering sacrifices at Darbhanga’s Shyama Mai Temple. Locals are taking to the streets in protest of this order. Giriraj Singh, a Bihar MP and Union Minister from Begusarai, has also objected to this directive. He has questioned whether Bakrid can be subject to the same restrictions placed on sacrificers at the Shyama Mai temple. “Offering sacrifices is a part of our religion as well,” said Giriraj Singh, the Minister of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj Department in the ministry headed by Modi. According to him, Sanatan has been practicing sacrifices since the beginning of time. He asserted that only jhatka meat should be consumed by Hindus. Speaking in his Lok Sabha constituency Begusarai on Sunday (December 18, 2023), he said that he ‘appreciates’ Muslims who are dedicated to their religion. Those Muslims have decided that they will consume only Halal meat. Hindus should also show a similar commitment to their religious traditions, Singh said.“I admire the Muslims who make it a point to consume only halal meat. Now Hindus should demonstrate a similar commitment to their own religious traditions. The Hindu way of slaughter is jhatka. Whenever Hindus perform ‘bali’ (animal sacrifice), they do so in a single stroke. As such, they must not corrupt themselves by eating halal meat. They must always stick to jhatka,” he said. #WATCH | Patna, Bihar: Union Minister Giriraj Singh says, ""Sanatana Dharma has 'bali pratha' (animal sacrifice) since ages…I have said that I respect my Muslim brothers. They are so committed to their religion that they only consume halal meat…To protect and respect your… pic.twitter.com/v1W5vpAYuOHe asserted that to preserve their faith, Hindus should only consume Jhatka meat. “Don’t eat meat if you fail to find it,” he said. Additionally, he revealed that the Sanatan method of sacrifice involved a single act of killing called ‘Jhatka’. In contrast, the animal in halal is killed slowly. It is not appropriate for Hindus to consume this kind of meat and violate the traditions. He administered an oath to the people present in the meeting that they would all eat Jhatka meat only and would not eat Halal meat. He urged the young people to visit the temple in the evening. He said that there is no better religion than Sanatan in the whole world.Remarkably, Giriraj Singh recently demanded in a letter to Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar that the state bans the sale of halal goods, just like Uttar Pradesh does. Last month, the Uttar Pradesh government took a decisive step against the illegal issuance of ‘Halal Certificates,’ issuing an order prohibiting the manufacture, storage, distribution, and sale of food products bearing the halal certification. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman defended the UP government’s decision as well. She stated that food certification should only be performed by government agencies and not by non-governmental organizations.The BJP was embroiled in a squabble, with opposition leaders condemning the move. Akhilesh Yadav, the chief of the Samajwadi Party, attacked the Bharatiya Janata Party for banning Halal products, accusing them of causing a divide between communities.Giriraj Singh thanked the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister for the investigation into ‘Halal Products’ at the time.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"18 December, 2023 ",Half of Bengal’s population will one day speak Urdu: Old video of Kolkata Mayor thanking Mamata Banerjee for making it second language goes viral,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/old-video-kolkata-mayor-firhad-hakim-urdu-propehcy-half-population-west-bengal-viral/,"In February 2012, Mamata Banerjee made Urdu the second language in areas of West Bengal where the population of Urdu speakers was equal or more than 10%.On Saturday (16th December), a video of incumbent Kolkata Mayor Firhad Hakim endorsing Urduisation of West Bengal went viral on social media.In a video shared on X (formerly Twitter) by user ‘Mintu Roy’, Hakim was heard saying, “Inshallah, one day will come when half of the population of Bengal will speak Urdu and recite poetry.” His remark aimed at the promotion of Urdu in West Bengal was greeted with applause by Muslims present at the event. It must be mentioned that Bengalis have a history of resisting the imposition of non-native languages particularly Urdu. Watch the video👇 pic.twitter.com/sXzRjE4yuBIn fact, one of the reasons leading up to the Bangladesh Liberation War was the imposition of Urdu over Bengali in then-East Pakistan. As such, the prophecy by Kolkata Mayor that half of the State of West Bengal will one day speak in Urdu was meant to spark controversy. The viral video of Firhad Hakim was recorded on 11th February 2021 during an event hosted by the West Bengal Urdu Academy.During the event dubbed ‘Mushaira 2021’, he was heard saying, “There was a time when Urdu speakers did not feel like they belonged to Bengal. There was no official status for Urdu. I want to thank Mamata Banerjee for making Urdu the second official language of Bengal.”“We have increased the budget of the Urdu Academy to ₹15 crore,” he informed. Firhad Hakim said that his ancestors came from Bihar and spoke Urdu at home. He also called upon the West Bengal Urdu Academy to take measures to propagate the language in the State of West Bengal.It must be mentioned that Mamata Banerjee engaged in appeasement politics soon after becoming the Chief Minister of West Bengal in 2011. A year later in February 2012, she made Urdu the second language in areas of the State where Urdu speakers were equal to or more than 10% of the population.The Trinamool Congress government had identified a total of 18 such Urdu-speaking areas -Goalpokhar I and II blocks, Islalmpur block, Kolkata Municipal Corporation, Islampur Municipality, Garulia Municipality, Titagarh Municipality, Kamarhati Municipality, Bhatpara Municipality, Champdani Municipality, Bansberia Municipality, Bhadreswar Municipality, Rishra Municipality, Asansol Municipal Corporation, Jamuria Municipality, Raniganj Municipality, Kulti Municipality and Bally Municipality.However, this is not the first time when the Mayor of Kolkata has been in the news for the wrong reasons. In April 2016, he had dubbed a Muslim-dominated area of Kolkata as ‘Mini-Pakistan‘ In February 2021, he was spotted delivering a political speech at a masjid in Kolkata, in blatant violation of the Model Code of Conduct. To pacify Muslim rioters during the anti-CAA movement, Firhad Hakim referred to them as ‘brothers.’ The Kolkata Mayor was earlier seen referring to the Central Armed forces and the BJP as ‘Suar er baccha‘ (progency of pigs).Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"18 December, 2023 ","Ashok Gehlot ruined Rajasthan’s economy, left a debt of Rs 5.37 lakh crore on the state, failed to boost GDP",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/ashok-gehlot-rajasthans-economy-left-a-debt-of-rs-5-37-lakh-crore-on-the-state-failed-to-boost-gdp/,"Rajasthan is presently drowning in debt. A report by the Reserve Bank of India shows that Rajasthan has a debt of Rs 5.37 lakh crore by the end of the financial year 2022-23. This debt was only Rs 2.81 lakh crore in 2018 when Ashok Gehlot took over the office. Ashok Gehlot has imposed a new loan of Rs 2.55 lakh crore on Rajasthan in the last five years.The state of Rajasthan welcomed its new Chief Minister Bhajanlal Sharma last week. Sharma took the oath of office as Rajasthan’s 16th chief minister. Additionally, he’s made some important decisions. But much remains to be done, particularly because Rajasthan’s economy suffered considerable harm due to the previous Congress administration under Ashok Gehlot.In Rajasthan, changing the government every five years has become a trend for the past thirty years. Nevertheless, the state’s economy has suffered each time the Congress government has taken office. The statistics indicate the same thing this time around.Although Rajasthan has one of the highest debt-to-GDP ratios in the nation and a massive debt load, its GDP has not increased significantly over the previous five years. Apart from this, the Gehlot government’s profligacy has left the state in the throes of a severe economic crisis.Rajasthan is presently drowning in debt. A report by the Reserve Bank of India shows that Rajasthan has a debt of Rs 5.37 lakh crore by the end of the financial year 2022-23. This debt was only Rs 2.81 lakh crore in 2018 when Ashok Gehlot took over the office. Ashok Gehlot has imposed a new loan of Rs 2.55 lakh crore on Rajasthan in the last five years.The Congress government looted the government treasury continuously to bring in new appeasement schemes and get votes. It is noteworthy that Ashok Gehlot referred to the Rs 1.63 lakh crore loan taken by the previous Vasundhara Raje government as extremely high when he took office in 2018. He is now the one who has buried the state in debt.Rajasthan’s financial situation is appalling. This state’s debt amounts to 40% of its GDP. It shouldn’t go over 20% in any state, according to the FRBM Act, which establishes borrowing caps for the federal government and the states. However, it has doubled as a result of the Congress government’s extravagant spending.It’s not like accepting this loan would have allowed Ashok Gehlot to propel the state’s development in a new direction. Conversely, the economy of Rajasthan has expanded at a fairly normal rate during his tenure. When the state’s Congress government left office in 2013, Rajasthan’s GDP was Rs 4.93 lakh crore.Under the BJP government, it rose to Rs 6.28 lakh crore by 2018. Following this, the state’s GDP was Rs 7.99 lakh crore in 2023 compared to 2018. Over these two periods, the state’s GDP grew by 27.2%. Yet, the Congress government borrowed far more money to achieve the same growth.The Congress government has indulged in careless expenses to carry on its appeasement policies over the last 5 years. The difference between the state’s revenue and expenses, or the fiscal deficit, has grown dramatically over the previous five years. It was Rs 25,342 crore in 2018, the year the BJP government was forced to resign, and it has more than doubled to Rs 58,212 crore when Ashok Gehlot leaves office in 2023. This represents 4.3% of the GDP of Rajasthan. The rule says it should not exceed 3%.Ashok Gehlot has left office after taking the state’s economy on a nosedive. Under these circumstances, Bhajanlal Sharma, the new chief minister, will need to exercise extreme caution. He will need to pay back debts while simultaneously bringing the economy back to life. Apart from this, strengthening law and order will be critical to the growth of the economy.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"18 December, 2023 ","Hindu activist Bittu Bajrangi’s family plunged into financial crisis as brother Mahesh fights for his life, future of family’s only child in jeopardy",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/hindu-activist-bittu-bajrangis-family-plunged-into-financial-crisis-as-brother-mahesh-fights-for-his-life/,"OpIndia spoke to the family of Bittu Bajrangi who are all constantly stationed outside the hospital. Police has also been deployed and only doctors are allowed to speak to Mahesh. The attackers, who poured thinner on and set fire to Mahesh, were led by an Armaan.On 13th December night (Wednesday), an attempt was made on the life of Mahesh, the younger brother of Hindu activist Bittu Bajrangi, in Dabua Colony, Faridabad.The accused tried to burn Mahesh Panchal alive. He remains in a critical condition and has been transferred to a third hospital for treatment.35-year-old Mahesh, who has suffered 60% burns, is the father of a daughter. The daughter is the only successor of Bittu’s family.Bittu Bajrangi family’s survives with hand-to-mouth earnings by selling vegetables. OpIndia team met Bittu Bajrangi’s family on Thursday (14 December 2023).Bittu Bajrangi’s entire family was present in Prachi Hospital in Faridabad where we met them. Bittu’s father and mother have died a long time ago. Bittu is not married.The reason for this, he says, is to dedicate himself to the service of Hindu dharma. Bittu’s brother Mahesh, who was set on fire by pouring thinner, is admitted in the burn ward of the hospital.Policemen were seen deployed at the gate. Apart from administrative officials, no one is allowed to meet Mahesh except doctors.We saw a girl of about 5 years playing at the gate of the hospital. When we asked her name, the girl introduced herself as Deepika.Deepika said her father’s name is Mahesh. Deepika is too young to realise the seriousness of what has happened to her father.She says she is student of class KG. She identifies her father as Kariya too, which is Mahesh’s nickname at home. She also recited ABCD to us.Her mother, Mahesh’s wife, could not hold back her tears while we tried speaking to her.When we asked Deepika what she wants to become when she grows up, she said, ‘a doctor’. When we asked her the reason for becoming a doctor, she said she wants to cure sick people.Deepika may be too young to ascertain the seriousness of the situation, but she knows that something has happened to her father. This was clear to us when she said that the first person she will give injection to when she becomes a doctor is her father.Deepika’s mother told us that her daughter is a bright student but due to incidents like Bittu’s arrest and now the attack on her husband, her daughter’s studies are getting affected a lot.The family has spent all their money on Mahesh’s treatment and is now facing a financial crisis.OpIndia spoke to Bittu about his family background. Bittu said that his late father had built a small house in Faridabad by doing small jobs.Their family lives in the same house. After the death of their father, Bittu and his brother Mahesh started supporting the family by selling vegetables.Due to Bittu’s involvement with Hindu organizations, the responsibility of running the family fell on his brother Mahesh. Mahesh was married in a village near Palwal. Five years ago he became the father of a girl. This girl is now the only light in Bittu Bajrangi’s house.On the day of the incident, Mahesh was selling vegetable at his shop. A group of men threw thinner on him and set him on fire. Mahesh’s in-laws were also present at the hospital.Speaking to OpIndia on the evening of 16th December, Bittu Bajrangi said that his brother’s condition has improved by about 10%. He also told that due to the calamity at home, his niece’s education has stopped.In one of his Facebook posts, Bittu Bajrangi has also accused local leaders of ignoring him. Apart from Arman Khan, no other name has come to light among the accused till now. SIT is investigating the case.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Looks like your newsroom is filled with Stalin fanbois from radical left universities.As per various Russian accounts, a whopping 20 million people are said to have perished under Joseph Stalin’s regime, after being at the receiving end of labour camps, forced collectivisation, famine and executions.Besides these measures, Stalin had also initially colluded with the Nazis during the latter’s Polish invasion in 1939 and at the end of the war, the Communist soldiers under Stalin have been alleged to have raped at least 2 million German women.In a century, communist states have killed approximately 100 million people, according to Ilya Somin’s articles. Joseph Stalin’s attempts to collectivise agriculture and production in Russia resulted in the deaths of 6 to 10 million people. Stalin imposed collective agriculture, prohibiting people from cultivating on their own, and imprisoning dissenters in Siberian labour camps. In Russia and Ukraine, millions went hungry, and hundreds of thousands died in prison camps. When Ukrainian production fell short of Stalin’s quota, he punished them even more by taking away everything they had. In Ukraine, Stalin’s forced famine is termed ‘Holodomor’ by joining the words for hunger (holod) and mor (extermination or mass-murder).Stalin’s atrocities were not restricted to the Soviet famine; he also carried out the ‘Great Purge,’ in which everyone he disapproved of was imprisoned, tortured, or executed. No one was spared, even wealthy peasants, politicians, military men, and ethnic minorities. The Purge alone is thought to have killed over 1.2 million people.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

"18 December, 2023 ","Assaulted for not praying to Jesus, visiting church and force-fed wine: Pandita Ramabai Mission booked for confinement, conversion of minor girls in Pune",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/fir-against-pandita-ramabai-mission-for-confinement-conversion-minor-girls-to-christianity/,"As per the FIR copy obtained by OpIndia, all four accused have been booked under sections 354B (Assault or use of criminal force to woman with intent to disrobe), 341 (Punishment for wrongful restraint), 295A and 298 of the Indian Penal Code and sections 11 and 12 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012.Last month, OpIndia reported an exclusive case from the Pune district of Maharashtra where two minor girls were forcefully sent to an orphanage in Daund and were forcefully converted to Christianity. The girls were also forced to clean toilets, were influenced against Hinduism and Hindu Gods and Goddesses, and were beaten, and tortured after their mother’s death in the year 2020. The Police have taken cognizance of the event and have filed an FIR against the Pandita Ramabai Mukti Mission and its three Matrons identified as Sakshi Bhalerao, Nisha More, and Vaishali Bhasker for assaulting and torturing the minor girls and converting them to Christianity. As per the FIR copy obtained by OpIndia, all four accused have been booked under sections 354B (Assault or use of criminal force to woman with intent to disrobe), 341 (Punishment for wrongful restraint), 295A (Whoever, with deliberate and malicious intention of outraging the religious feelings of any class) and 298 of the Indian Penal Code and sections 11 and 12 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. FIR has been filed based on the complaint registered by one of the maternal aunts of the victims. It has come to the fore that the two minor girls aged 9 and 11 respectively were confined to the Pandita Ramabai Mukti Mission orphanage which is located in the Daund region of the Pune district. The girls were forced to clean public toilets and were not provided with good food and clothes in the orphanage. They also were forced to take baths in public by the authorities at the orphanage. The girls were converted to Christianity and baptized by the authorities at the orphanage. They were also forced to go to church on Sundays and were barred from wearing Bindi, bangles, and any Hindu religious symbol in jewellery form on their body. They were brain-fed that “Hindu Gods are dead. They don’t exist. People only apply haldi kumkum on idols unnecessarily.” The girls were also made to believe that Jesus is the only existing God. The aunt of the girl mentioned in the complaint that she was rarely allowed to meet the girls for 1 and a half years and was not allowed to take them at home for vacations. The aunt of the girls also said that the orphanage refused to hand over the girls to the family saying that they were receiving foreign funds from every girl confined in the orphanage and that they could not afford to lose the girls for money. “However, they kept on trying to convince us that the girls were being taken care of and that they would be sent to foreign countries for education. But we were being cheated,” the complainant said. The two victim minor girls are from the Shivajinagar area of Pune. They had been staying with their maternal aunt in the Bhavani Peth area after their mother died. The girls’ father shared minimal bond with them given that they were girls. “My sister and her husband shared no relation after these two girls were born. She had been staying with our mother in Pune. And after she died in 2021, I took responsibility for her daughters (two victims of this case),” said the maternal aunt of the two minor girls. As per the information obtained by OpIndia, the girls had been studying at the Bapusaheb Pawar Prathmik School in Bhavani Peth. Some of the NGOs like the Bharatiya Samajseva Kendra were associated with the school ensuring the welfare of the students. In the year 2021, one of the social workers from the NGO called the aunt of the girls and said that the father of the girls wouldn’t take proper care of the girls. She suggested the woman admit the girls into a good hostel for better education and lifestyle. Despite several refusals from the aunt, the social worker convinced the family and contacted the Bal Kalyan Samiti in Yerwada through which she got the girls admitted to Pandita Ramabai Mukti Mission in Daund. The aunt of the girls was assured that they would be allowed to meet the girls and talk to them over the phone whenever they wanted. The aunt and the other family members of the girls were also assured that all the financial needs of the girls would be taken care of and that they would be sent to foreign for further education. The authorities at the orphanage also reportedly told the family that the marriage expenses of the women would also be taken care of. Earlier, the aunt of the girls was told that they would be kept at the hostel. However, they were deceptively kept at the orphanage and were confined for almost two years. The girls were not allowed to meet their aunts and were not allowed to communicate with them openly. The two minor girls in their confession to the police said that they were tortured at the orphanage and were not provided with proper clothes, food, and other basic needs. The girls also said that they were made to clean public toilets and wash vessels at the orphanage. As per the FIR- The aunt of the girls maintained in the complaint that the girls would not be allowed to talk properly to them. They would be kept watch on continuously when we would visit them. “After the admission of the girls to the hostel (orphanage), me and my two other sisters went to meet the girls. The first time we were treated very nicely. But as I demanded to take the girls home for a few days or vacations they would not allow. Slowly slowly they began keeping us away from the girls. Someone from the orphanage authorities would always be present with the girls ensuring that they don’t reveal the atrocities faced by them,” the aunt said. On 3rd May 2023, after the mistreatment came to the fore, the father of the girls submitted a letter to the orphanage saying that he wanted his kids back and that he was capable enough to take care of them. Nisha More from the orphanage then rejected the proposal and said that the girls now belonged to the orphanage and that ‘the father now had no relation with the girls.’ Accused Nisha More also replied to the father saying that the orphanage received specific amounts from the foreign countries behind every child in the orphanage and that they would not lose the girls. She further convinced the father saying that the orphanage would take all the financial responsibility of his kids and need not worry about them now. The girl’s aunt learned about the orphanage’s response and found it scary. She sought help from the Bal Kalyan Samiti to get custody of the kids. However, the authorities at the Samiti, Wasim Sheikh, and other women officials abused her and hurled caste-related abuse. “You low-caste, illiterate people will never change,” the authorities said. The Pandita Ramabai Mukti Mission in Kedgaon, Daund, was established in the year 1889. As per its official website, the missionary is ‘committed to the empowerment of destitute women and children since 1889’. It is a Christ-centered home where destitute women and children irrespective of their background are ‘cared for’, transformed, and empowered as per the vision statement mentioned on its website. “We seek, in the Spirit of Christ, to sow seeds of change in the lives of every individual under the care of Mukti Mission, skillfully counselling them to Deal with the issues of life, Initiating varied opportunities of healing and shaping them prayerfully as models of God’s kingdom for the society at large,” the NGO’s mission statement reads. The basis and operation of the Mission are based on Isaiah 61: 1 & 4 of the Bible which reads, “The spirit of the Sovereign Lord is on me, because the lord has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners.” In the given case, the two minor girls have been forcefully converted by the Missionary. As reported earlier, the entire incident got exposed when one of the aunts got associated with a Pune-based NGO named the Indian Human Rights Council (IHRC) and local Hindu organizations. The complaint was then sent to the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) which issued a notice seeking severe action in the case. The Commission also noted that the details of the two minors had not been uploaded on the Commission’s Bal Swaraj Portal- Covid Care given the reason for the death of the minor’s mother was suspicion of COVID-19. The girls were finally released by the Pandita Ramabai Mukti Mission on 11th November 2023 and were safely handed over to the aunts by the local Hindu organizations. Team OpIndia tried to contact the orphanage for a comment but to no avail. A complaint has been filed against the Pandita Ramabai Mukti Mission and its three Matrons identified as Sakshi Bhalerao, Nisha More, and Vaishali Bhasker for assaulting and torturing the minor girls and converting them to Christianity. All four accused have been booked under sections 354B (Assault or use of criminal force to woman with intent to disrobe), 341 (Punishment for wrongful restraint), 295A (Whoever, with deliberate and malicious intention of outraging the religious feelings of any class) and 298 of the Indian Penal Code and sections 11 and 12 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 based on the complaint registered by one of the maternal aunts of the victims.

"18 December, 2023 ",‘Dawood Zinda Hai’ – From Gangrene to Covid to poisoning: How Pakistan-resident Dawood Ibrahim keeps dying of a different cause every year,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/pakistan-dawood-ibrahim-different-cause-death-every-year/,"There was a rumour on social media that some unknown assailants poisoned Dawood Ibrahim, and he was admitted to hospital in critical condition.On 18th December, while Indian social media was abuzz with the unconfirmed reports of notorious terrorist Dawood Ibrahim being poisoned and in critical condition, Republic TV confirmed that those were just rumours. In a report, Republic TV noted that a relative of Dawood Ibrahim dismissed the claims made in social media reports that Dawood was admitted to a hospital in Karachi, Pakistan, due to health complications.There were reports that unknown persons poisoned the most wanted Indian terrorist. Speaking to Republic TV, the relative claimed that Dawood was not poisoned. The relative said, “News of poisoning is not correct. Also, we are unaware of his whereabouts”.Dawood Ibrahim is one of the most notorious and dreaded gangsters/terrorists that India has ever seen. A criminal mobster and drug dealer from Mumbai, it is believed that Dawood Ibrahim now resides in Karachi, Pakistan. He was designated as a global terrorist in 2003 by India and the United States, with a reward of US$25 million for his capture for his role in the 1993 Bombay bombings. In 2011, the FBI and Forbes named him number three on The World’s 10 Most Wanted Fugitives. While Dawood’s death rumours are all over social media, it has to be noted that such rumours find their place on social media platforms once or twice every year. It is a fact that Dawood Ibrahim is hiding in Pakistan, and the hostile neighbour categorically refuses to accept his presence in the country.On 17th December 2023, there was a rumour on social media that some unknown assailants poisoned Dawood Ibrahim, and he was admitted to hospital in critical condition. The rumour surfaced after the internet went kaput in Pakistan to curb the circulation of videos of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s virtual rally. Fake screenshots of Pakistan PM’s posts, and fanning of the rumours by journalists fed fuel to the rumours. In 2020, there were reports that Dawood Ibrahim and his wife contracted Coronavirus. It was one of the “silver lining” reports during the COVID-19 pandemic. Later, it was reported that he died of the infection. However, the reports were proven wrong, and Dawood lived. However, his nephew Siraj Kaskar, the son of Dawood’s elder brother Sabir Kaskar, did die of COVID-19 in Pakistan. In 2017, there were reports that Dawood died of a heart attack. Some reports suggested he had a brain tumour that led to his worsening health. However, the reports later proved to be fake. Chota Shakeel, Dawood’s right hand man, said in a statement, “Listening to my voice, do you think any such thing has happened? These are all rumours, Bhai is fit and fine.”In 2016, there was another rumour on social media that Dawood got gangrene on his legs, and doctors might have had to amputate them. In April 2016, CNN News18 reported that Dawood Ibrahim was suffering from an advanced stage of gangrene, and soon, doctors would not have any option but to cut off his legs. The report further claimed that if his situation worsened and he died, it would be a big blow to India’s efforts to bring him to justice. NDTV put the terrorist on death bed and reported there was a hunt for his successor. Times of India busted the rumour quoting Chota Shakeel who said, “Your agencies have the wrong information. Dawood is perfectly fit.”While Dawood Ibrahim is still alive, several wanted terrorists and their associates have been killed by unknown assailants in Pakistan. OpIndia’s detailed report on terrorists being killed by unnamed assailants in Pakistan can be checked here.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

On Friday (15th December) night, about 10 idols of deities kept in three Hindu temples were vandalised in Alfadanga upazila in Faridpur district in Dhaka Division of Bangladesh.As per a report in Prothom Alo, the three desecrated temples were identified as Kendriya Hari Mandir, Sri Sri Vishnu Pagal Mandir and Sri Sri Damodar Akhara. The places of worship are located within 1 km of the Alfadanga municipality.According to the Bengali daily, four idols of Goddess Manasa, Durga, Lakshmi, Saraswati and one idol of Lord Shiva were vandalised at the Kendriya Hari Mandir. Similarly, two idols of Lord Shiva and Goddess Manasa were destroyed at the Sri Sri Vishnu Pagal Mandir.The unidentified miscreants also vandalised a Shivling and idols of Lord Shiva and Lord Narayana, which were kept at the Sri Sri Damodar Akhara. In total, they attacked 10 idols belonging to Hindu gods and Goddesses.After the matter came to light, the locals informed the police. While speaking about the incident, Officer-in-Charge of the (Alfadanga) police station Salim Reza said that the cops reached the crime spot immediately after receiving information.He said that a case would be filed and that the CCTV footage of the temple premises was collected. On Sunday (17th December), members of the Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council (HBCUC) staged a demonstration at Alfadanga Chowrastra, demanding rapid action against those involved in idol vandalism. A human chain was formed by the protestors seeking justice against religious persecution. A day earlier, another protest march was organised jointly by the Upazila Puja Udayapan Committee and HBCUC.Earlier on 6th November, a case of temple desecration and idol vandalism came to light in the Bijulia village of Shailkupa upazila of Bangladesh. After learning about the incident, the local Hindus alerted the police. A similar case of idol vandalism took place in the area in October 2022. Islamists orchestrated it under the supervision of a Chhatra League (student wing of Bangladesh Awami League) leader. “Last year, they broke the idol of Goddess Kali and discarded the head of the deity. There is an upcoming election in the country. I hope such incidents are not repeated this time…I hope we can live in peace,” a local Hindu woman said.In February this year, OpIndia reported about a series of planned attacks on at least 14 Hindu temples across the Islamic country.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

As per the subtitles in the video, she was seen saying that Islam is not compatible with European values and culture. Islam is being perpetrated (in Italy) through Saudi Arabia’s funding and Saudi Arabia has Sharia law. Meloni further says that the Sharia law is not compatible with Europian values and culture.

NDTV used a X post embed of a handle named Geopolitical Kid and wrote that Meloni’s statement was given during the political event organised by her party. However, Meloni’s statement regarding Islam’s alleged incompatibility wasn’t found in any international publications in the last 24-hour window. Radio Genoa, a popular handle on X, seemed to have first posted the video.

Salvini, referring to the Cologne mass sexual attacks and Berlin terrorist attack, had said that Islam is incompatible with European values. Salvni is a leader of Italy’s Lega Nord party. Conclusion: While the viral video of Giorgia Meloni is mostly correct in rough translation, the video, or the statement, are not recent. They are from 5 years ago, and not from the recent political event organised by Meloni’s party. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"18 December, 2023 ",Fact Check: Did Pakistani caretaker PM confirm that unknown men poisoned Dawood Ibrahim? Here is the truth,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/fact-check-pakistani-caretaker-pm-dawood-ibrahim-death-confirmation/,"Dawood Ibrahim was designated as a global terrorist in 2003 by India and the United States with a reward of US$25 million for his capture for his believed role in the 1993 Bombay bombings. On Monday (18th December), social media was abuzz with rumours of the death of wanted terrorist Dawood Ibrahim, who has been hiding in Pakistan for decades. As per the rumours, Ibrahim was poisoned by an unknown person, and he was rushed to hospital. Some posts on social media claimed he was critical, while others claimed that he died. The rumours began spreading on Sunday (17th December) after Pakistan’s internet went down.Amid the rumours, an alleged screenshot of caretaker Prime Minister of Pakistan, Anwaar Ul Haq Kakar, went viral on social media with claims that the said post confirmed the death of Ibrahim. The post read, “The Messiah of humanity, dear to every Pakistani heart, our beloved His Excellency Dawood Ibrahim passed away due to poisoned by unknown. He breathed his last in a hospital in Karachi. May Allah grant him the highest position in Jannat. Inna Lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji’un.”However, when OpIndia investigated the screenshot and the official handle of the Pakistani PM, we found that there was no such tweet. Furthermore, the handle used in the screenshot was anwaar_kakkar, while the real ID of the Pakistani PM is anwaar_kakar. There is a handle called anwaar_kakkar, but that is a fan account of PM Kakar, and there was no such tweet either. It was evident that someone artificially created the post by adding text and a Grey Verified Check Mark on the fan account.Pakistani journalists also fuelled the rumours. In a recent episode of Bheja Fry, Pakistani journalist Aarzoo Kazmi talked about the rumours surrounding the poisoning of Dawood Ibrahim and his critical health in the hospital. She highlighted the fact that there was an internet shutdown in the country and emphasised that something was happening in Pakistan. She also talked about the rumours of Dawood Ibrahim’s poisoning and critical health. While she fanned the rumours, the rumours of Ibrahim’s death remained unconfirmed.As per Aaj Tak, Ibrahim was indeed admitted to the hospital two days back. It is unclear what was the reason, but several reports talked about the rumours of him being poisoned.Though the rumours of Ibrahim’s death remained unconfirmed, it was indeed a fact that internet services faced a massive crackdown in Pakistan on 17th December. Social media services and search engines stopped working without any prior notice. No one could access social media platforms like X, Facebook, YouTube, etc., and the Google search engine was down. While it was rumoured that the crackdown was because of the poisoning of Ibrahim, in reality, it appeared that the Pakistani government shut down the internet to limit the access and circulation of videos of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s virtual rally.Dawood Ibrahim is one of the most notorious and dreaded gangsters that India has ever seen. A criminal mobster and drug dealer in Mumbai. It is believed that he now resides in Karachi, Pakistan. He was designated as a global terrorist in 2003 by India and the United States with a reward of US$25 million for his capture for his believed role in the 1993 Bombay bombings. In 2011, the FBI and Forbes named him number three on The World’s 10 Most Wanted Fugitives.While Ibrahim’s death rumours are all over social media, it has to be noted that such rumours find their place on social media platforms once or twice every year. It is a fact that Ibrahim is hiding in Pakistan, and the hostile neighbour categorically refused to accept his presence in the country.OpIndia’s detailed report on terrorists being killed by unnamed assailants in Pakistan can be checked here.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"18 December, 2023 ",Beginning of collapse of constitutional machinery: Kerala Governor slams CM Pinarayi Vijayan for putting defamatory posters outside his guest house,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/kerala-governor-arif-mohammed-khan-vs-chief-minister-pinarayi-vijayan/,"The black banners and posters have been placed inside the campus, just outside the University Guest House where the Governor is staying, Kerala Raj Bhavan released the statement.Kerala Governor Arif Mohammed Khan has taken serious note of the action of the State Police, on the direction of the Chief Minister, in placing posters defamatory to the Governor in the campus of Calicut University.The black banners and posters have been placed inside the campus, just outside the University Guest House where the Governor is staying, Kerala Raj Bhavan released the statement.Governor feels that this cannot happen without the direction of the chief minister and that this clearly is the beginning of the collapse of the constitutional machinery in the state. He said that such deliberate actions of the Chief Minister precipitate the breakdown of constitutional machinery.Coming down heavily on Kerala Governor Arif Mohammad Khan, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Sunday accused him of attempting to disrupt the peaceful ambience in the state. Speaking to reporters, Vijayan said, “Arif Mohammad Khan is making a move to destroy the peaceful ambience of Kerala.”After facing a black-flag protest from members of the SFI, the students’ wing of the ruling CPI(M), the Governor claimed an attempt on his life.However, the chief minister said the governor’s actions were such that they sparked protests.CM Vijayan further highlighted the comments made by former Supreme Court justice Rohinton Nariman in a public event in Mumbai, outlining the “wholesale reference to the President,” of Bills by the Kerala governor.Vijayan further accused the governor of allegedly accepting proposals from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which, according to him, resulted in the student protests. The chief minister opposed his actions, calling them “totally wrong.”Also drawing attention to the Governor’s choice of words, Vijayan questioned how he could use such harsh language. He also expressed concern over the Governor’s approach towards individuals, who showed him black flags. He termed the action as ‘provocative’.Earlier, SFI (Students Federation of India), the student wing of the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist), staged a black-flag protest march to Calicut University, ahead of the Governor’s arrival on campus.Black banners and posters were put up outside Calicut University Guest House where the Governor was staying. The protesters were, however, removed from the spot by the police on the instruction of the Governor’s office.A statement from Raj Bhavan mentioned that the Governor took serious note of the action of the state police, on the direction of the Chief Minister, in placing posters defamatory to him on the campus of Calicut University.The Governor earlier claimed that the police were prevented from acting against ‘criminals’. He also accused CM Vijayan of hatching a conspiracy to harm him.“This is not a question of my comment, as I said in the morning. It is about law. We are a democratic republic and the law must prevail. The police stood like silent bystanders while the protesters were at it. It was because of political reasons that they stood by idly. My car was surrounded and the protesters banged on it with all the force that they could muster,” the Governor said.He added that he was not scared of anyone. “Due to political reasons, the Kerala Police were prevented from acting against these rowdies and criminals. I believe in facing up to brutes. I am not scared of anyone,” he added. (This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

On 17th December (Sunday), Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti said that the Supreme Court’s 11th December ruling on Article 370 is not a “God’s verdict”. Speaking with reporters in Kupwara, she asserted that her party, PDP will continue to struggle for the restoration of special status to Jammu and Kashmir.Mufti said, “We don’t have to lose heart. We will continue our struggle. The Supreme Court is not God. The same Supreme Court had earlier said that Article 370 cannot be amended without the recommendation of a constituent assembly. They were also learned judges. Today some other judges passed the ruling. We cannot treat it as God’s verdict.”#WATCH | On Supreme Court verdict on Article 370 in J&K, PDP Chief Mehbooba Mufti says, ""…Supreme Court's verdict is not God's verdict, we will not lose hope and will continue our fight."" pic.twitter.com/iDpFN7TWDWShe claimed that those who oppose special status to Jammu and Kashmir, want “us to give up” on our fight. The PDP President stressed that they will not lose hope and continue the fight in this regard. She added, “Our opponents want us to give up the fight but we will continue till our last breath. We have made a lot of sacrifices and we cannot let them go in vain.” Previously, the PDP leader had described the apex court’s verdict on pleas challenging the abrogation of Article 370 as a “death sentence” not only for Jammu and Kashmir but also for the idea of India. Stating that the struggle in the region has been a political fight spanning several decades, Mufti had urged people not to lose hope.  Likewise, Omar Abdullah, the vice-president of the National Conference, conveyed his disappointment over Article 370 article. Dil na umeed tou nahi ⁰Na kaam hi tou hai ⁰Lambi hai gham ki shaam⁰Magar shaam hi tou haiIt is important to note that both the valley leaders who have been actively seen indulging in political activities had earlier claimed that they were house-arrested by the LG administration in the wake of the Article 370 verdict. They had also alleged that were they not allowed to talk with reporters. However, the claim was immediately rejected by Jammu and Kashmir LG Manoj Sinha and Srinagar Police calling their allegations “totally baseless”.On 11th December, the Supreme Court of India upheld the Centre’s decision to abrogate Article 370 which granted special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir. The five-judge constitutional bench noted that J&K did not retain any sovereignty after the instrument of accession was signed and there is no internal sovereignty for Jammu and Kashmir. It also ruled that Article 370 was a temporary provision. The court also asked the Election Commission to conduct the election to the Union Territory’s Assembly by September 30 next year.The National Democratic Alliance (NDA)-led government at the Centre under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi revoked Article 370, taking away the special status of the state of Jammu and Kashmir on 5th August 2019. The state was then reorganised into two Union Territories, Ladakh and Jammu, and Kashmir.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"17 December, 2023 ",Congress govt in Telangana sanctions Rs 2.4 crore for Tablighi Jamat event to be held at Parigi in January next year,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/congress-govt-in-telangana-sanctions-rs-2-4-crore-for-tablighi-jamat-event/,"Parigi Congress MLA Dr. T RamMohan Reddy stated he was able to swiftly acquire the funds marking his first major achievement since taking office just over a week agoJust a week after coming to power in Telangana, the Congress government in the state has approved the allocation of Rs 2,45,93,847 crore to host an Islamic congregation in Nematnagar village of Pargi Mandal in Vikarabad district from 6th to 8th January 2024. The Tabliqhi Jamat-organised Subaee Deeni Ijtema is expected to draw between three and five lakh Muslims from Telangana, Andhra Pradesh.After careful consideration and conversation with Chief Minister Revanh Reddy, Parigi Congress MLA Dr. T RamMohan Reddy stated he was able to swiftly acquire the funds marking his first major achievement since taking office just over a week ago. Syed Umar Jaleel, Secretary of Minority Welfare, released an order stating that the money from multiple departments had been approved for the program. The Vikarabad district collector suggested setting aside the sum to provide several amenities at the venue. He is going to receive the money allotted by the Waqf Board. The CEO of the Waqf Board has been selected by the government as the nodal officer responsible for guaranteeing the timely completion of the proposed works.The different divisions receive their share of the assigned monies. A contribution of Rs 85 lakh has been made to Mission Bhagiratha which is focused on SUMP development and water delivery. The building of pipelines from ponds to the congregation location has been assigned a sum of Rs 68 lakh. The Panchayat Raj Engineering Department would supervise the development of the roads and parking areas with a budget of Rs 40 lakh. For Rs 48,35,847, transformers are going to be installed to provide a continuous power supply and transmission. The cost of the maintenance work would be Rs 4.58 lakh.Earlier, when the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) was in power, on 23rd August, the district collector for Vikarabad calculated that about 7 crores would be needed for the occasion and he forwarded the proposal to the government for approval. Subaee Deeni Ijtema preparations are already underway. Salman Khan, a member of Hyderabad Youth Courage NGO who was detained in a case involving bogus crowd fundraising and is subject to the Preventive Detention Act urged other Muslims to show up in strength for this rally. The media was told by the locals that three to five lakh Muslims are anticipated to travel to Parigi, which is located 85 kilometres from Hyderabad. This three-day Islamic assembly is scheduled to include members of Delhi Hazrat Nizamuddin.Noatbly, in 2019 Syed Umar Jaleel, an IAS officer and former Vikarabad district collector was suspended for seven months. His willful breach of an Election Commission order by opening sealed 122 EVMs and VVPATs in the strong rooms resulted in this disciplinary penalty. It is important to remember that he took these measures despite a petition on the Vikarabad assembly elections still sitting in the high court and awaiting a decision.He was appointed as the Commissioner of Intermediate Education and the Secretary of the Intermediate Board following a seven-month suspension. He subsequently announced his retirement in September 2022. Surprisingly, the BRS government once again elevated him to a prominent position in July 2022. This time for a two-year tenure, he assumed the duties of Secretary and Commissioner of the Telangana Minority Welfare Department.A similar gathering was conducted by Tablighi Jamaat in Delhi in March 2020 during which the deadly Covid virus was prevalent and most of the attendees were infected. Moreover, they scattered around the nation, causing the virus to spread widely. It was found after a police inquiry that a large number of foreigners attended this event as well and travelled to different regions of the nation which presented a security danger.The Tablighi Jamaat congregation and its activities are prohibited in many Islamic countries. Saudi Arabia outlawed Tablighi Jamaat in December 2021, referring to it as “one of the gates of terrorism.” The Tablighi Jamaat was outlawed and classified as an extremist organisation in Kazakhstan in 2013. Additionally, Iran, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan forbade the Islamic movement. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

The X users circulated the visuals from the Gomti bridge with misleading claims that the authority scattered their goods and assaulted the vendors. However, they were immediately fact-checked by the Lucknow Police. Spinning Police action as oppression of the poor, Asif Khan tweeted, “Poor Kashmiri dry fruit vendors were harassed by Lucknow Municipality team.

VIP movement traverses through this route because of which the  Municipal corporation and police regularly carry out anti-encroachment drives.”Misleading. @zoo_bear won't share that – vendors were asked to vacate no-vending zone several times before.

He added that the corporation had taken action previously, and the police had communicated with the vendors. East DCP Lucknow mentioned that today (17th December), the convoy of UP CM Yogi Adityanath also passed through this route. He added that today the dry fruit vendors showed indecency with the anti-encroachment team. Subsequently, when the police came to learn about the incident, they used the necessary force and brought the youths to the police station. They have been informed that this is a VIP route adding that they should cooperate with the anti-encroachment drives in the future as well.It is also notable that while the X users claimed police threw away the dry fruits being sold by the street vendors, others have said that the vendors themselves dropped the products on the streets after police asked them to vacate the place. Therefore, the police removed the street vendors not because of their identities as Kashmiris, but only because they were vending at an unauthorised place.

"17 December, 2023 ","Canada: Amidst online Hinduphobic attacks on the new 55-feet Lord Hanuman statue in Brampton, temple decides to enhance security",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/new-hanuman-statue-in-brampton-receives-hatred-from-canadians/,"The Hindu Sabha Mandir in Brampton is constructing a 55-foot-tall statue of the Hindu deity Hanuman, which will be inaugurated in April next year to commemorate Hanuman Jayanti. A temple in Canada’s Greater Toronto Area (GTA) is increasing security after receiving complaints and discriminatory remarks on social media about a massive statue of Lord Hanuman being put up on its grounds.The Hindu Sabha Mandir in Brampton is constructing a 55-foot-tall statue of the Hindu deity Hanuman, which will be inaugurated in April next year to commemorate Hanuman Jayanti. According to a temple priest, the statue is 95% finished, with minor work on the pedestal remaining.Notably, in recent months Brampton has seen a surge in pro-Khalistan activity. In July, “War Zone” posters threatening Indian diplomats in Canada appeared outside the Bharat Mata Mandir in Brampton.Known for his expertise in sculpting Hindu deities, Rajasthan sculptor Naresh Kumawat is creating the Lord Hanuman statue. Kumawat has erected over 200 statues in more than 80 countries.Speaking to Hindustan Times, the temple priest Phool Kumar Sharma said, “There is security at our temple, and we will be keeping watch at night as well.”Sharma stated that there have been complaints to the authorities as well as social media outrage by some people who are discontented with the statue’s installation. The priest, however, clarified that the statue is sponsored by donations, is being made on the temple grounds and does not violate any municipal regulations.Notably, a section of Canadian netizens have unleashed a bigoted attack on the Hindu community over the statue of Lord Hanuman with many posting derogatory comments about Hindu Canadians and the Hindu gods as well.One Cosmin Dzsurdzsa wrote, “Hinduism is heavily invested in the meaning and power of symbols. Although Western thought has largely discounted religious symbolism as irrational and superstitious, ignoring an obvious projection of power in the form of a massive deific monument will be to our detriment. Why would somebody feel the need to erect a 50-foot idol outside for non-believers to see and not in a temple? The psychological motivation is curious and a legitimate question.”Why would somebody feel the need to erect a 50 foot idol outside for non-believers to see and not in a temple?

The recent online attacks only expose the deep-seated hatred for the Hindu faith and Hindus in general.If we look at the data, according to a 2021 census, Canada has a Christian population of over 19.3 million making up over half of the Canadian population. It is interesting to note that India, a Hindu majority country is home to more Christians than a Christian majority Canada with a population of over 28 million, according to 2011 census data, making them the third largest religious community in the country. Despite being a Hindu majority nation, India has always been tolerant towards religious institutions, places of worship, statues etc.When Hindu temples are attacked by Khalistani terrorists, the same intolerant Canadians go into hibernation, yet go berserk over a 55-foot statue of a Hindu god, claiming that Hindu religious symbolism is being forced in a Christian-majority Canada. In recent months, Khalistani terrorists have attacked Hindu temples in several parts of Canada, vandalising the temples and defacing the walls with anti-India and anti-Hindu graffiti, with Canadian authorities taking no concrete action. The question arises as to how one immigrant community, whose places of worship are constantly subjected to hatred and attacks by extremist sections of another and yet remains law-abiding, will obliterate or destroy “Canadian culture,” which it does not seek to do.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

He stated that raids were conducted at DMCH after the video emerged, leading to the recovery of three bottles of foreign-made liquor. On 17th December (Sunday), photos and visuals of doctors allegedly consuming alcohol at a party in the dry state of Bihar started doing rounds on social media platforms. The incident of doctors partying with alcohol reportedly took place inside the guest house of Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital (DMCH). However, it was interrupted when someone barged in with a camera.As per reports, the party took place during the ongoing conference of paediatricians, Pedicon 2023, which is being organised at DMCH between 14-17 December.Notably, the visuals of the alcohol party were captured on camera. The footage revealed sealed imported liquor bottles abandoned on the floor after those consuming it quickly dispersed upon noticing the camera. After the visuals of medical professionals consuming alcohol in the dry state went viral, the Darbhanga Police sprung into action. Speaking with India Today TV, Darbhanga’s Sub-Divisional Police Officer, Amit Kumar confirmed the authenticity of the viral visuals. He stated that raids were conducted at DMCH after the video emerged, leading to the recovery of three bottles of foreign-made liquor. Kumar said, “It is claimed that a liquor party was organised on the DMCH campus. All video evidence will be examined and people concerned questioned.” Following the viral videos, opposition leaders launched a scathing attack on the Bihar government’s claim of making Bihar a dry state. Sharing photographs of the incident, Jan Adhikar Party (JAP) chief Pappu Yadav alleged that the Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) served as an “adda for sharab, shabab and Kabab (hub for women, wine & dine)”. He also claimed that he saw it firsthand when he was taken for treatment while in jail.बिहार में ग़रीबों के शराबबंदी का अलग क़ानून है और DMCH के प्रिंसिपल और डॉक्टरों के लिए अलग क़ानून है क्या?दरभंगा में पेडिकॉन कांफ्रेंस में शराब परोसी जा रही थी। डॉक्टर लोग लुत्फ़ उठा रहे थे, प्रशासन सोई हुई थी, आख़िर कब तक यह चलेगा??मुख्यमंत्री जी @NitishKumar जी संज्ञान लें pic.twitter.com/vOIHVNGcRLAs per reports, the doctors caught in the viral frame included DMCH Principal Dr KN Mishra who outrightly denied the allegations. He claimed that he did not consume any alcohol and if anyone proves this, he will immediately leave his post. Regarding his presence at the alcohol party caught in the viral videos, he argued that someone had misused his photo and video as people could find his photo and video somewhere. According to him, the photo looks edited and he got information from news channels and newspapers. At the Pedicon conference, many doctors have come from Delhi, Mumbai, and Gujarat, for whom arrangements have been made to stay in many hotels and guest houses in the city. Now it is not possible to check their luggage, he further argued in his defence.He added that now that the incident has come to light, they are forming three to four investigation committees. This committee will investigate and submit a report in three days as to how and by whom the liquor was brought to the guest house. Presently Pedicon is going on in the guest house in which more than 509 doctors have come from outside. Regarding Pappu Yadav’s allegations of setting up a liquor den, the DMCH principal added that if any doctor is caught drinking or sees someone drinking then they should tell the hospital authorities. He added that the Pedicon is not an organisation of DMCH, it is organised by the Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP). In this institution, there are four times more doctors from outside Darbhanga than the number of doctors there, he added.It is important to note that Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar imposed a ban on alcohol consumption in 2016, making it a dry state.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Content creators don’t appear to be stopping anytime soon even in the face of criticism from the public and constant reminders from the authorities. One such social media celebrity recently found herself in trouble when police intervened over a widely shared video of her dancing inside Mumbai’s railway stations. Instagram user Seema Kanojiya posted a video on her account issuing an apology for her illegal act.A post shared by Seema Kanojiya (@seemakanojiya87)She has now expressed regret for bothering the passengers. Seema Kanojiya recently released a clip surrounded by two police officers as she apologised for her objectionable behaviour. The dance video was uploaded on 2nd December by the social media influencer who has over 5.59 lakh Instagram followers. Since then, it has minted over 94.5 million views. She could be witnessed stepping off a stationary train while a Bollywood song plays in the background and running into two men who were crossing the platform. She began to dance on the platform and a large group gathered around her, leaving the men looking bewildered.She wrote, “Don’t make videos or reels at railway platforms and inside trains. Passengers face problems and it’s an offence. I’m sorry to make reels at the railway platform at Andheri and CSMT,” along with the footage of her apologising while a male and female police personnel stood on either side of her. She agreed that it was a legal offence to record such content on a train platform that caused inconvenience to other people and expressed surprise at the video’s popularity. She also implored other social media influencers to take note of her error and not repeat the mistake. A post shared by Seema Kanojiya (@seemakanojiya87)The Central Railway reacted in a tweet earlier after the footage of her leaping off a train and performing dance moves in front of guys on a railroad platform gained traction on social media. It read, “Passengers are requested to refrain from such activities which cause disturbance to other passengers. Under Railway Act sections 152 & 153, it’s a punishable offence with a penalty & imprisonment of up to 10 years for the charges of hurting/attempting to hurt other passengers.

Alliance with eighteen other anti-BJP parties, including Congress, Trinamool Congress, Janata Dal (United) and others.On 17th December, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)’s chief and Delhi’s Chief Minister, Arvind Kejriwal, expressed his desire to contest all thirteen Lok Sabha seats in Punjab and one Lok Sabha seat in Chandigarh in the upcoming Lok Sabha Elections. Notably, AAP is part of I.N.D.I. Alliance with eighteen other anti-BJP parties, including Congress, Trinamool Congress, Janata Dal (United) and others.During a public meeting in Bathinda, Punjab, with Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann, Arvind Kejriwal said, “All these parties are sad. They feel that their jobs have been taken away permanently. No one is going to vote for them again. The way [AAP formed] government three times in Delhi, you will give a majority vote to AAP in the next elections. Lok Sabha elections are not far away. There are 13 seats in Punjab and one seat in Chandigarh. My heart says the way people are getting benefitted; you should give all 13 seats to us and make us strong.”This is not the first time Congress and AAP have come face-to-face over seat sharing in Punjab. On 12th December, Punjab Congress chief Amarinder Singh Raja Warring said that his party would contest all 13 Lok Sabha seats in Punjab. Furthermore, he added that the high command had not given any instructions for contesting the upcoming General elections in any alliance.On 14th December, AAP chief spokesperson Malvinder Singh Kang said, “While the party high command’s final decision is to be taken, we are already preparing in all 13 Lok Sabha constituencies. The Chief Minister had declared in the Hoshiarpur rally that we will contest in all 13 seats.”Notably, Kejriwal’s statement came just two days before the I.N.D.I Alliance meeting that is scheduled for 19th December. This is going to be the first meeting of the alliance after Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) defeated Congress in Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh assembly elections. Following the defeat, Congress called for a meeting of its allies, which was first scheduled for the 6th of this month, before getting postponed to the 19th.

Interestingly some of the others who also helped him have now switched to the BJP,"" Sardesai had claimed.Days after the Income Tax (IT) Department recovered a whopping ₹353 crore from the offices of Dhiraj Prasad Sahu, ‘journalist’ Rajdeep Sardesai came to the rescue of the Congress MP.In a video posted on his YouTube channel on Friday (16th December), Sardesai claimed that the scam-tainted politician had no chance of being a Parliamentarian. While citing a make-believe ‘source’, he alleged that the Congress wanted to deny Sahu a ticket to the Rajya Sabha in 2018. The controversial ‘journalist’ claimed that the party relented after leaders, who have now defected to the BJP, lobbied for him. He also made reference to a ‘dead’ Congress leader who supposedly influenced the decision of the party to send Dhiraj Prasad Sahu to the Rajya Sabha.At a time when the grand-old-party is under scanner over allegations of corruption, Rajdeep Sardesai was seen making a last-ditch effort to give a clean chit to the Congress’ high command.“A senior Congress leader from Jharkhand claims Sahu was to be denied a ticket in 2018 but he reportedly managed to get his Rajya Sabha nomination at the very last moment with the help of a very key people in the Congress hierarchy in the National Capital,” he was heard saying.“Among his key benefactors is someone who is no longer alive and held the purse strings of the Congress for a very long time. Interestingly some of the others who also helped him have now switched to the BJP,” Sardesai brazened out.Dhiraj Prasad Sahu is a Rajya Sabha MP for Congress from Jharkhand. His family has been associated with the Congress party since independence. He became RS MP in by-polls in 2009 for the first time. In 2010, he was elected as RS MP for the second time; in 2018, he was re-elected for RS by Congress for the third time. He actively participates in parliamentary proceedings. Sahu was part of Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Yatra. In recent raids at Odisha-based Boudh Distillery Pvt Ltd, where Dhiraj Prasad Sahu is a partner, the Income Tax Department recovered ₹353 cr of unaccounted cash.

"17 December, 2023 ","Karnataka: BJP MP Pratap Simha slams Congress MLA’s proposal to rename Mysuru Airport after Tipu Sultan, says the name “Nalvadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar Airport” was...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/bjp-mp-pratap-simha-slams-congress-mlas-proposal-to-rename-mysuru-airport-after-tipu-sultan/,"Pratap Simha said that the previous government led by former Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai had already proposed to name Mysuru airport after Nalwadi Krishnaraja WadiyarOn 16th December, Pratap Simha, the Bharatiya Janata Party MP from Mysuru-Kodagu in Karnataka strongly objected to the Congress party’s suggestion to rename the Mysuru airport in honour of Tipu Sultan, the Islamist monarch of the 18th century. He criticised the proposal saying that the formal procedure to name the airport after Mysuru’s 20th-century king Nalvadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar was already almost finalised.He responded by calling the proposal to name it after Tipu Sultan ridiculous and pointing out that the airport had previously received approval to be renamed in commemoration of Nalvadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar.The BJP leader disclosed in a statement that he had earlier recommended that the Mysuru airport be renamed “Sri Nalvadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar Airport” in May 2022. He further maintained that the cabinet had accepted the same and that Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai had requested that Rs 35 crore be allotted for the airport’s runway development.He conveyed, “The Cabinet also approved this nomination. The previous government led by former Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai had already proposed to name Mysuru airport after Nalwadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar. He subsequently wrote to the Centre on August 1, 2022, making the recommendation. The union government will soon make an official statement about the name, and it is in the final stages. It is unfair for Congress to create such confusion among people by passing unruly statements.”Furthermore, he charged that Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah is attempting to cater to a particular community in the Mysuru area. “Siddaramaiah has no respect for Yaduvansha. During his first term, Siddarmaaiah permitted Tipu Jayanti to hurt the feelings of the people of Mysuru and Kodavas when they were against it. Congress is trying to appease a community for their vote bank politics by twisting the history. I will not allow the Congress to rename Mysuru Airport after Tipu Sultan.” “Who is he trying to appease by elevating Tipu Sultan as a heroic figure,” the parliamentarian asked. He announced, “Under no circumstances will I permit Mysuru airport to be named after Tipu Sultan. I will steadfastly support the sentiments of the people of Mysuru-Kodagu, who unanimously desire the airport to be named after Nalvadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar. I stand as their voice, unwavering in my stance.” Congress MLA Prasad Abbayya from Hubballi-Dharwad (East) came up with the proposal of renaming the Mysuru airport after Tipu Sultan during a discussion about the state government writing to the Centre to change the names of airports. “I am 101 per cent still defend my decision demanding the Mysuru Airport to be named after Tipu Sultan. He gave Dalits and backward classes respect in society. Tipu Sultan brought the Land Reforms Act and helped backward-class people. I am a fan of Tipu Sultan. There is no need to appease any community,” he claimed while defending his controversial decision.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"17 December, 2023 ",Parliament Security Breach: Lalit Jha shared the video of the intrusion with a friend from Bengal urging him to circulate it,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/lalit-jha-parliament-security-breach-friend-bengal-video/,"Sourav Chakraborty, who hails from West Bengal, said he had known Jha since May 2014 and had met him via Facebook.On 17th December, a friend of Parliament security breach’s mastermind, Lalit Jha, told India Today that he had received the video of the breach from Jha with a request to circulate it on social media. Sourav Chakraborty, who hails from West Bengal, said he had known Jha since May 2014 and had met him via Facebook. However, he never knew what Jha was planning.Chakraborty said, “We met on Facebook. He used to like and comment on my posts on social media. He used to support me in my Facebook posts. I have known him since May 14, but he never told me anything along these lines (Parliament security breach incident).” He further stated that if the incident had taken place “before 1947”, he would have supported it. He called it an “unnecessary” act now. He said, “He (Jha) used to speak about social justice and welfare. He never told me or hinted at such a kind of plan.” Lalit Jha and Chakraborty met in Kolkata during two rallies. Jha had helped Chakraborty in making arrangements for a rally in Uttar Pradesh.Reports suggest that Jha had sought Rs 7 lakh from his father a few months ago. A team from Baheda Police Station questioned his parents at their house in district Danbanga of Bihar. During questioning, his father, Devanant Jha, said he was informed about Lalit’s arrest via phone by Delhi Police on 15th December.The police also checked his mobile phone and asked about some photos and videos stored on the device. Lalit’s father said in a statement that he had asked for Rs 7 lakh a few months back. He claimed to have cleared the NEET exam and sought money for admission to a private college as his rank was low. However, due to his financial condition, Devanand could not help his son. He claimed his son was innocent and urged police not to take any strict action against him.On 14th December, the 22nd anniversary of the 2001 Parliament terror attack, a major security breach occurred when two intruders entered the Lok Sabha chamber from the visitor gallery during Zero Hour.

"17 December, 2023 ",Porn scandal rocks US Capitol: Democrat Senator Ben Cardin’s legal aide fired after filming gay sex tape in Senate Hearing room,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/us-senator-ben-cardins-legal-aide-fired-after-filming-gay-sex-tape-in-senate-hearing-room/,"Slamming the Biden government, several netizens shared the Biden couple’s earlier “decency” posts along with obscene pictures of LGBTQ+ activists outside the White House as well as scandalous pictures of Hunter Biden with seemingly minor kids or banned substances. The US Capitol has recently been rocked by a porn scandal involving one of the legal aides of Democratic Senator Ben Cardin who has now been fired. As per US media reports, a staffer named Aidan Maese-Czeropski associated with Cardin’s office filmed himself while copulating with a man in the Hart Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill. The scandal came to light on Friday (15th December) after the video was leaked online.The 8-second graphic video was published by the Daily Caller on Friday. The video was embedded in an article authored by Henry Rodgers, who reported that the video was initially shared in a group chat for gay men in politics. The video appears to show a pair of men copulating in Hart 216, the same room where the 9/11 commission hearings were held and former FBI Director James Comey delivered testimony about Donald Trump in 2017. After media reports surfaced, the United States Capitol Police initiated an investigation into potential criminal violations when the video started circulating.Meanwhile, initially, Cardin’s office declined to comment on the video, calling it a “personnel matter.” But on Saturday (16th December), his office confirmed to Politico that Maese-Czropski “is no longer employed by the U.S. Senate.” A spokeswoman from Cardin’s office told The New York Post, “Aidan Maese-Czeropski is no longer employed by the U.S. Senate. We will have no further comment on this personnel matter.” Although the Daily Caller which published the graphic video did not identify the two men caught in the leaked video, several conservative outlets identified Aidan Maese-Czropski, Maryland Democrat Senator Ben Cardin’s aide, as one of the participants caught in the obscene video. NYT reported that Maese-Czeropski, a 24-year-old legislative aide, was accused of posting a video of himself in flagrante delicto with another man on a public X account. His face appeared to be clearly visible, according to The Spectator, which first broke the story on Friday. Following the reports, Maese-Czropski on Friday, in a cryptic post on LinkedIn, claimed that while “some of my actions in the past have shown poor judgement,” he would “never disrespect [his] workplace.” He, however, did not make any reference to the video.Alleging that he is being attacked for a ‘political agenda’, his post read, “This has been a difficult time for me, as I have been attacked for who I love to pursue a political agenda. While some of my actions in the past have shown poor judgement, I love my job and would never disrespect my workplace. Any attempts to characterize my actions otherwise are fabricated and I will be exploring what legal options are available to me in these matters.”Additionally, on Friday, Rep. Max Miller (R-Ohio) told the Daily Caller that Maese-Czeropski was the staffer who approached him and said “free Palestine” during an interview with NBC News earlier this week. While responding to the claims that he yelled ‘Free Palestine’ slogans at a Jewish Congressman in the Capitol hallway, Maese-Czropski noted in his LinkedIn post, “As for the accusations regarding Congressman Max Miller, I have never seen the congressman and had no opportunity or cause to yell or confront him.”  Moreover, according to his LinkedIn profile, he has been employed in Cardin’s office since October 2021. Before this role, he served as a field organiser for the Democratic Party in Virginia and worked as a climate researcher for the charity Friends of the Earth.NYT further reported that Maese-Czeropski had previously featured in an ad for President Biden which earned Biden a shoutout from his mother’s now-deleted X account. In a November 2020 post, his mother said, “Thank you for including my son, Aidan Maese-Czeropski, in your thoughtful message to everyone who has supported you.

"17 December, 2023 ",King of Bhutan thanks PM Modi and India for support in rail network during his National Day address,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/bhutans-king-thanks-india-pm-modi-support-railway-project-national-day/,"The Railway project was discussed between King Wangchuck and PM Modi during the King's visit to India in early November. On 17th December, King of Bhutan, Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, highlighted the recently announced railway project between India and Bhutan in his National Day address. The railway project is set to connect Gelephu in Bhutan to Kokrajhar in Assam, India. It is aimed to improve diplomatic and economic relations between the two neighbouring countries.Watch: During national day address, Bhutan's King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck mentions the first ever Bhutan India Railway connect; thanks PM Modi & India govt for supporting the project. pic.twitter.com/sQz2KGqP2qSpeaking on the National Day, King Wangchuck said, “Around 2 billion people in South Asia…It’s a period of awakening for the region, a period of growth, a period of immense opportunities.” Furthermore, he thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and India for the Railway project, connectivity and support for the project.Bhutan celebrated its 116th National Day on 17th December. On this day, the first King of Bhutan, Gongsar Ugyen Wangchuck, was coronated in 1907, marking the country’s unification.The Railway project was discussed between King Wangchuck and PM Modi during the King’s visit to India in early November. It is being touted as King’s legacy as it will reshape the regional landscape by improving connectivity, trade and economic cooperation between India and Bhutan. It will also improve employment in Bhutan. Reportedly, Bhutan is facing a brain drain as many youths are opting to leave the country and settle abroad in countries like Australia. During his address, the King emphasised improving up-skilling in the country.The Indian Railways has already completed the Preliminary Engineering-cum-Traffic (PET) survey for the project. Furthermore, plans are underway to upgrade the existing Land Customs station at Dadgiri in Assam to an integrated Check Post as part of the project. Similar upgrades are being planned at Gelephu in Bhutan to ensure a seamless trade environment.Once completed, further possibilities to extend the project to Banarhat in West Bengal and Samtse in Bhutan will be explored.In November, the joint statement issued by India and Bhutan read, “During the visit to Assam, Hon’ble Governor of Assam Shri Gulab Chand Kataria hosted a dinner in honour of His Majesty. Hon’ble Chief Minister of Assam Dr Himanta Biswa Sarma, called on His Majesty and discussed a wide range of issues, including rail connectivity, cross-border trade infrastructure, economic cooperation, tourism, education, skill development, environmental conservation, and nurturing people-to-people connections.To further expand bilateral cooperation on trade, technology, cross-border connectivity, mutual investments, education and people-to-people connections, the following was agreed upon:To undertake the Final Location Survey (FLS), in consultation with the Bhutanese side, of the proposed cross-border rail link connecting Kokrajhar in Assam to Gelephu in Bhutan through GoI support. The two sides noted successful completion of the Preliminary Engineering-cum-Traffic (PET) survey of the rail-link by Indian Railways. The two sides also agreed to consider establishing rail-link between Banarhat (West Bengal) and Samtse (Bhutan).To designate Darranga (Assam)/Samdrup Jongkhar (Bhutan) as immigration check post between Bhutan and India to facilitate the entry and exit of third country nationals by land route for enhancing connectivity, and promoting tourism.GOI to positively consider Bhutan’s request for concessional financing in the area of skill development and capacity building under the GyalSung Project.To designate Haldibari (West Bengal) – Chilahati (Bangladesh) rail route as an additional trade route for Bhutan’s trade with Bangladesh.”In August this year, Minister of External Affairs, Dr S Jaishankar, had talked about the said railway project. Addressing the media, Dr Jaishankar emphasised on the importance of enhancing trade and tourism opportunities with Bhutan via the railway link.Notably, while Bhutan-India relations continue to thrive, the situation is quite the opposite when it comes to the relations between Bhutan and its other neighbour, China. Relations between them have been deteriorating over the years because of the land disputes. In 2021, it was reported that China had established a new village in the south of the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) and named it Gyalaphug in Tibetan or Jieluobu in Chinese. China has been developing the 232-square-mile area with settlers, security personnel, and military infrastructure originally belonging to Bhutan. The new construction commenced under President Xi Jinping’s significant drive along Himalayan frontiers.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"17 December, 2023 ",‘I am a servant of Mahakal’: Madhya Pradesh CM Mohan Yadav on breaking 211-year-old myth of Ujjain,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/madhya-pradesh-cm-mohan-yadav-breaks-211-year-old-myth-of-ujjain/,"By spending a night at Ujjain, MP CM Mohan Yadav broke the myth that only one king can stay there, and Lord Mahakal is considered the king of the city. However, Yadav said that he is not king but a servant of the LordFrom breaking records to myths, the Bhartiya Janata Party has been ahead of its rivals as seen in the recent electoral victories in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. In this line, BJP leader and the new Chief Minister Dr Mohan Yadav has broken the “Ujjain jinx” on Saturday (December 16).Dr. Mohan Yadav visited Ujjain after being sworn in as Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh on December 13 and performed ‘Rudrabhishek’ at Mahakaleshwar Temple. However, contrary to popular belief, the newly-elected chief minister returned to his residence in Ujjain and stayed the night, shocking everyone.On Saturday, CM Yadav attended the Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra (VBSY) in Ujjain. Prime Minister Narendra Modi interacted with and addressed the beneficiaries of the VBSY via video conferencing. Notably, VBSY recently completed its one month. ""विकास की ये लहर, पहुंचेगी हर गांव हर शहर""  आदरणीय प्रधानमंत्री श्री @narendramodi जी के विकसित भारत के संकल्‍प को पूरा करने में हम कोई कसर नहीं छोड़ेंगे। आज महाकाल की नगरी उज्‍जैन से #विकसित_भारत_संकल्प_यात्रा को हरी झंडी दिखाकर रवाना किया। pic.twitter.com/X5wAjpKnZcIt’s worth noting that Ujjain has an old myth that only one ‘Raja’ can spend the night here. And since Lord Mahakal is revered as ‘Ujjain’s Raja,’ no other chief or the ruler can spend the night here. It is claimed that if any head of state, chief minister, or prime minister spends a night in Ujjain, they will lose power and government. Interestingly, since Lord Mahakal is revered as the king of Ujjain, he is also given a Guard of Honour similar to the Guard of Honour given to “Ram Raja” daily in Orchha where Lord Ram is revered as the king.The Ujjain jinx holds prominence due to several instances wherein political leaders had to lose their constitutional post after spending the night in Ujjain. Interestingly, it is said that former Prime Minister Morarji Desai had spent a night in Ujjain back in 1979 and the very next day he had to resign mid-term. Similarly, former Karnataka CM Yediyurappa who is said to have stayed in Ujjain for nearly 20 days also lost power.Since Ujjain is CM Mohan Yadav’s hometown, he is aware of the prevalent myth. However, CM Yadav opines that he is not a Raja or king but a mere servant and son of Lord Mahakal. He said “I am no king, only Mahakal is the king. I am only his son. These myths are all pointless. I had instructed the collector to take me to KD Gate and then only I would go to my home. I can spend the night here as I have been a servant of Mahakal since childhood and was born here only, thus the myth does not apply to me.”जय श्री राम! pic.twitter.com/lexxvFS2KqCM Mohan Yadav also hinted that a cabinet meeting will also be held in Ujjain. This meeting could take place in January 2024.Before breaking the myth, CM Yadav while addressing a public gathering said that this myth was floated 211 years ago by the then-king Daulat Rao Scindia. CM Yadav further stated that after the death of Madhya Pradesh’s then-king, Mahadji Scindia, Daulat Rao Scindia intended to relocate the state capital from Ujjain to Gwalior. Due to this, he created this myth. He stated that because Ujjain has only one ruler, Baba Mahakal, two kings cannot stay there.While it is a matter of subjective interpretation of the occurrence of such incidents. Some may dismiss it as superstition and myth while others may hold their beliefs as true. However, several priests and saints are of the view that since this does not find any mention in the Hindu scriptures, it cannot be considered valid from the religious point of view.CM Mohan Yadav’s move warrants recalling the infamous “Noida jinx“. Yogi Adityanath, the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, broke the ‘Noida Jinx’ by visiting Noida in December 2017. This superstition began in 1988, shortly after former Chief Minister Vir Bahadur Singh lost power after visiting Noida. It was commonly believed that any chief minister who visited Noida would lose power. Despite the prevalence of this myth, the then newly-elected chief minister Yogi Adityanath visited Noida to inaugurate metro projects and other development projects.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"17 December, 2023 ","Uttarakhand: Woman files for divorce 2 years after marriage, gets husband’s job after he died",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/uttarakhand-man-dies-before-court-could-rule-on-divorce-wife-gets-his-job/,"The High Court has decided that Sarita's standing as the deceased's lawfully wedded wife is unaltered and allowed for her compassionate appointment.In Uttarakhand, a woman got her husband’s job after he died, even though a divorce case was going on. The Uttarakhand High Court awarded the woman named Sarita compassionate appointment, who had filed for divorce from her husband Hari Sevak because of their problematic relationship, reported The Times of India.Sarita filed for divorce in 2015, barely two years after the wedding in 2013, alleging that he used to abuse her. Her husband worked as a watchman at a Tuberculosis (TB) hospital in Nainital. However, he died in 2019 when he was 40 years before the legal battle was settled.Sarita promptly applied for a compassionate appointment in the post occupied by her late husband. Amit Kumar, Hari’s brother objected to the move and cited his right to the same because of the ongoing divorce proceedings. He also went to the High Court, but he also passed away in October. The High Court has now decided that Sarita’s standing as the deceased’s lawfully wedded wife is unaltered and allowed for her compassionate appointment.Sarita’s lawyer Prabhat Bohra informed, “Class 12 pass-out Sarita was married to Hari in February 2013 when she was 26. Hari was a heavy drinker and due to his habit, their relationship became so strained that Sarita was forced to file a divorce case in 2015.” He elaborated that the majority of family conflicts are settled through counselling at the mediation centre. Therefore, even after filing for divorce, the couple’s status as husband and wife is maintained by the courts until the matter is concluded.“For the compassionate appointment, the first and foremost claim is always of the wife of the deceased government servant. Moreover, the mess that her brother-in-law created, has now come to rest due to his demise. The hospital’s chief medical superintendent is directed to consider her claim for a compassionate appointment within six weeks,” the single bench of Justice Pankaj Purohit stated after considering the matter.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

However, he highlighted that in terms of the overall gems and jewelry sector, India’s share is only 3.5% in total export. He added that Surat has the potential to catapult India into double-digit figures, assuring that it is Modi’s guarantee that the government will be in its steadfast support. The PM noted that the Union government has already chosen this sector as a focus area for export. He listed out several measures taken by the Central government for the Diamond Industry, including promotion of patented design, diversification of export products, collaborating with other nations to improve the technology, and promotion of lab-grown or green diamonds. PM Modi added that the government has made special provisions for Green Diamond in the budget urging the people to make maximum utilisation of these measures.  Today, the global discourse is centered around India.'Made in India' has become an influential brand. pic.twitter.com/lp6zslx5XuPM Modi stated that the Union government has placed special emphasis on developing modern infrastructure in Surat. The city now boasts an International Airport, a metro rail service, and a coastal port capable of handling large cargo, including the Hazira port, a deep-sea LNG terminal, and a multi-cargo port. Surat is also becoming connected to international trading ports, a feature limited to very few cities globally. Moreover, Surat is part of the Bullet train project, and work on the western dedicated freight corridor is progressing rapidly. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

The victim is currently hospitalised at SVP Hospital in Ahmedabad, while the accused, Farooq Pathan is absconding. A police complaint has been filed, leading to the registration of a case. The police launched an investigation into this case.The incident took place in Sanadara village within the Galateshwar taluka of Kheda. The 33-year-old victim, residing in this village, got married in 2010 to a man from a nearby village. However, due to a dispute with her husband, she has been residing at her father’s house for the last three years. She is the mother of an 8-year-old son.According to her official complaint, the victim reported that Farooq Abbas Pathan, a resident of her village for the past two months, had been persistently stalking and pressuring her to engage in a romantic relationship. Despite her repeated refusals, Farooq continued to pursue her, insisting on initiating a love affair.On Thursday (14th December), at approximately 7 AM, Farooq Pathan abruptly approached the victim, hurling verbal abuse at her, including caste-related insulting remarks. Armed with a knife, Farooq Pathan attacked the victim’s neck. The victim tried to save herself with her hands during the assault. Consequently, serious wounds were inflicted on her wrists by the sharp-edged weapon.At the time of the attack, the victim was accompanied by her sister-in-law. Farooq Pathan also targeted the sister-in-law, attempting to cause physical harm to her, the victim’s son, and father. He then fled from there. The family members also rushed to the spot and moved the victim to the local hospital.Subsequently, she was transferred to SVP Hospital in Ahmedabad, following a referral, where necessary procedures and operations were conducted. Currently, the victim is receiving medical treatment and remains hospitalised.The Sewalia police have initiated legal proceedings by filing a case under the provisions of the Indian Penal Code, including sections 326 (voluntarily causing hurt by weapon), 504 (insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), and 506(2) (criminal intimidation). Additionally, Section 135 of the Gujarat Police Act and various sections of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act have been invoked. A comprehensive investigation is underway. The accused, Farooq Pathan, remains unapprehended as of the time of writing this report. OpIndia has a copy of the First Information Report (FIR).Speaking to OpIndia about the incident, one of the victim’s family members said, “He tried to slit her throat, but her wrists received serious cut injuries as she tried to shield her neck with her hands. Her thumb had a narrow escape when he attacked for the second time with that knife.”According to the family member, Farooq threatened to kidnap the victim’s son on his way to school and kill him, as well as the entire family. The family has now lodged a police complaint.Hindu organisations also rushed to the aid of the victim’s family after learning about the incident. Bhavesh Kansara, a Bajrang Dal worker from Ahmedabad, told OpIndia, “We rushed to the hospital along with our workers when the incident was reported. We are discussing what to do next after getting the details from the family. Our only aim is that the family should get justice and there should be awareness among the people on this issue and Hindu daughters should avoid getting trapped.” He added that Farooq’s family had also approached the victim’s family and talked about a solution, but they have categorically refused.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.
