The High Court asked for a policy within a week. CM Bhagwant Mann is the jail minister. What did he do?… Drug tablets are being sold inside the jails… If I am proven a liar, I will leave politics,” Sidhu said, speaking to reporters on Saturday.The Punjab and Haryana High Court has recently sought a status report from the Punjab and Haryana governments on the steps taken after the BSF gave a list of 75 individuals suspected of involvement in drug trafficking to the Punjab Police.The High Court took cognizance of a news article published in an English newspaper that mentioned that the Border Security Force (BSF) gave a list of 75 individuals suspected of involvement in drug trafficking to the Punjab Police.Moreover, the High Court has made the Punjab and Haryana governments and the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) parties in this case and has issued a notice and ordered them to file their replies.According to the data released by BSF, BSF has seized around 755 kg of narcotics so far in the year 2023. 95 drones coming from Pakistan have been shot down. 36 Pakistani nationals have been arrested, of whom 15 rifles and 38 pistols have been recovered. In addition to this, nine Pakistanis who were trying to cross the border have been killed.“The State of Punjab is directed to file a status report with respect to the steps being taken in pursuance of the report given to it by the BSF. The State of Haryana will also file a status report regarding the steps being taken in the state in the matter,” the court order read.“NCB is also directed to file a status report giving details of the persons suffering from drug addiction in the States of Punjab and Haryana and what kind of steps can be taken, to make persons who till date are not in drug addiction, aware of the drug menace, and how they should be prevented from taking drugs, as the narcotic items recovered in the State of Punjab, as reported in the news paper, are huge,” it added.Earlier on Monday, the Border Security Force (BSF) Special DG of Western Command said that it has given a list of suspected drug traders in the border areas of Punjab to the Punjab Police. The BSF has also recommended their detention under the Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1988.(With inputs from ANI)Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"16 December, 2023 ",‘Dharavi tender was finalised transparently when MVA govt was in power’: Adani group responds to Uddhav Thackeray’s allegations against the redevelopment project,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/adani-group-responds-to-uddhav-thackerays-allegations-against-the-dharavi-project/,"""It is unfortunate that a concerted effort is being made to disseminate misinformation about certain aspects of the project,"" a press release issued by Adani Group said after Uddhav Thackeray launched a protest against the projectOn 16th December (Saturday), Adani Group released a press statement asserting that the project for the redevelopment of the Dharavi slum in Mumbai was awarded to the Adani Group through a fair, open, and internationally competitive bidding process. The group highlighted that the tender conditions were finalised when the MVA government was in power.The official response from the company came in the backdrop that Shiv Sena (UBT) leader and former Maharashtra CM  Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday led a protest march of the party, alleging favour to Adani Group in connection with the Dharavi redevelopment project.Adani Group says, ""The Dharavi project was awarded to the Adani Group through a fair, open, internationally competitive bidding process.

Hence, it is wrong to claim that any special benefits have been given to the awardee.” #WATCH | Mumbai, Maharashtra | Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray led a protest march of the party, alleging favour to Adani Group in connection with the Dharavi redevelopment project.Visuals of the protest from earlier today, at T Junction of Dharavi area. pic.twitter.com/zFlevoCjX7The group reiterated that all eligible tenement holders will be moved into their new homes in Dharavi itself. As per the tender conditions, even ineligible tenement holders will be provided accommodation under the Rental Housing Policy. The tender provisions also ensure that eligible residential tenements will receive 17% more area than other SRA projects in Mumbai, the statement added.Meanwhile, addressing the protesters, Uddhav Thackeray alleged that the redevelopment project involves TDR irregularities worth more than Rs 100 crore, which is the “biggest scam in the world”. Leading the march from Dharavi to Adani office in Bandra, the former CM demanded that the government should redevelop the slum, not the Adani Group, and Dharavi residents should get the houses they deserve. Regarding the TDR allegations, the Adani group stressed that the resettlement of Dharavikars is not affected by Transferable Development Rights (TDR). Also, the TDR from the project will be managed and monitored transparently through a specially created portal by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) and the Government of Maharashtra, the group added in its press release.CM Eknath Shinde also countered Uddhav Thackeray for his opposition to the project, saying that when Uddhav Thackeray became the CM under the MVA alliance, he had stalled many projects started by the earlier BJP-Shiv Sena government, which had impeded the development of the state. Notably, in July, the Maharashtra government officially awarded the Dharavi Redevelopment project, spanning 259 hectares, to an Adani group firm.The Maharashtra government has entered into a 99-year lease agreement with the Indian Railways and then it will be sub-leased on 30 years+30 years basis like any other government land in Mumbai to the housing societies. There is no change in this policy for the Dharavi Redevelopment Project, the release added.The official release has been issued through the Spokesperson of Dharavi Redevelopment Project Private Ltd (DRPPL). In the statement, the Spokesperson added, “There is a general consensus, not only in Mumbai and Maharashtra but also across the whole of India, for transforming Dharavi and providing the people of Dharavi with better living conditions, adequate hygiene, education, and vocational training, healthcare, employment opportunities, essential amenities and a life of dignity.”The DRPPL stressed that the Dharavi project assumes added significance because many earlier attempts have failed to deliver. “There is no gainsaying the fact that a transformational project like Dharavi needs support from all stakeholders, including from political parties cutting across ideologies and differences. This is a historic opportunity to build a new, state-of-the-art Dharavi which reflects the hopes and aspirations of Dharavikars,” the press release further added. It is important to note that in August 2023, the Maharashtra government filed an affidavit regarding the project in the Bombay High Court. The affidavit stated that the tender process for the Dharavi redevelopment project was “absolutely transparent” and “no undue favour” was given to the highest bidder, Adani Group.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

He made the remarks while addressing the Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra in Sanand, Gujarat’s Ahmedabad district. Addressing the gathering in Gujarati, Home Minister Shah said, “In 2002, there were riots and thereafter Modi saheb taught a lesson to not repeat the act. Have there been riots thereafter? The rioters were taught such a lesson in 2002 that to date no one dares to cause riots in Gujarat.”ચાંગોદર, સાણંદ (ગુજરાત) ખાતે 'વિકસિત ભારત સંકલ્પ યાત્રા'માં જનતા સાથે સંવાદ… https://t.co/W5WTKGanLHHe also listed out the major achievements of the Modi government in the last nine-and-a-half years and credited the Prime Minister for abrogating Article 370 “in a jiffy”. He lauded PM Modi for improving the safety of the country and highlighted the recurrent bomb blasts across the country before 2014. Shah also highlighted the construction of Bhavya Ram Mandir which was otherwise housed in a ‘tent’. He added, “PM Narendra Modi worked to secure India by carrying out surgical strikes on Pakistan, realised the incomplete dream of abrogation of Article 370, undertook the work of constructing Lord Ram temple in Ayodhya, took India to the Moon through Chandrayaan mission, improved economic parameters to their best since independence, and led to the highest industrial development since independence.” Shah further noted, “Earlier, every day, we would have bomb blasts, print journalists would forget to print, and there would be so many blasts with no end to it. But with a surgical and air strike once, we taught Pakistan a lesson…Narendrabhai has made the country safer.”The Home Minister asserted, “The entire world reached the Moon but our flag could not. Narendrabhai sent Chandrayaan to the Moon and at Shivshakti point made our tricolour fly high. He has worked such that in the country’s economy, all parameters have been at their best in the past 75 years. If one takes 10-year intervals, industrial development has been the most during Narendrabhai’s tenure.” However, Shah argued that improving the quality of life of 60 crore poor people in the country has been the biggest achievement of the Narendra Modi government.“Several times, journalists ask me as to which of Narendra Modi’s achievements will get my highest marks. I say this without any controversy, confusion or dilemma that if I have to give the highest marks, then it will be Modi’s work to improve the quality of life of 60 crore poor,” he was quoted saying by The New Indian Express.Meanwhile, during the Sanand gram panchayat event, Shah also urged people to take a pledge to transform India into a developed country by 2047 while eradicating the “slavery mentality from its root”.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"16 December, 2023 ",PM Modi’s degree case: Gujarat court junks Kejriwal’s plea against nod to prosecute him in defamation complaint filed by Gujarat University,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/gujarat-court-junks-kejriwals-plea-against-prosecution-in-defamation-case-filed-by-gujarat-university/,"The court of additional chief metropolitan magistrate SJ Panchal rejected Arvind Kejriwal's plea, noting that no such sanction was required. On Friday (15th December), a metropolitan court in Gujarat rejected Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s plea opposing criminal prosecution in the defamation complaint filed by Gujarat University. The metropolitan court observed that there is no need for prior approval for his trial in this case, as the remarks made by the politician do not seem to have been made as part of the discharge of official duty.Notably, AAP National Convener Arvind Kejriwal and AAP Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh are facing trial in connection with a criminal defamation complaint filed by the registrar of Gujarat University Piyush Patel. The complaint pertains to their “sarcastic” and “derogatory” statements made in connection with PM Modi’s educational degree.Citing provisions of Section 197 of the CrPC, Kejriwal had sought protection asserting that a sanction was required to initiate a trial against him because he is a public servant.However, the court of additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate SJ Panchal rejected his plea, noting that no such sanction was required. The matter will now be heard on the next date set on 28th December.Earlier on 13th December, the AAP Supremo had filed an application before Panchal’s court. In his plea, the AAP leader challenged his prosecution in the matter as he is a public servant. His advocates had argued that since there was no permission from the proper authority to start a criminal case against him, the trial was not valid. They claimed that the comments were made as part of a public servant’s duty to ask questions.Gujarat University’s counsel Amit Nair opposed the application and asserted that Kejriwal made defamatory statements about the university and tarnished the image of the institution. He submitted that utterance of defamatory words does not fall under the category of discharge on official function and hence, such a sanction was not required in the present case. Additionally, on 13th December, magistrate Panchal had also rejected Kejriwal and co-accused Sanjay Singh’s applications that sought adjournment of proceedings in the defamation case. The court observed that prima facie there appeared to be a case against them under section 500 (defamation) of the Indian Penal Code(IPC) and had summoned the duo. The case against the AAP leaders was filed by GU registrar Piyush Patel following their comments, which came in response to the Gujarat High Court overturning the Chief Information Commissioner’s order regarding the PM’s degree.The complainant asserted that the AAP leaders made “defamatory” statements in press conferences and on their Twitter(now X), handles targeting the university over Modi’s degree. He said that their comments targeting Gujarat University were defamatory and hurt the prestige of the educational institution which has established its name among members of the public. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"14 December, 2023 ","N Ram pats his own back for a pompous, gassy editorial in The Hindu, The Wire has a monumental meltdown: Fallout of SC decision...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/n-ram-pompous-editorial-the-hindu-the-wire-meltdown-sc-decision-article-370/,"N.Ram, Siddarth Varadarajan and their ilk know very well that the Parliament can split or not split a state even when there is an elected government in place and the legislature wishes otherwise.On December 11th, the Supreme Court upheld the abolition of the dreaded Article 370 (I know it was repealed and therefore while Article 370 still exists in the Constitution, the original dreaded purpose for which it was intended doesn’t exist anymore). Certain sections of the English media; certain sections of the I.N.D.I alliance and the entire Congress party went bonkers over this decision of the Supreme Court. Watching their meltdowns gave me goosebumps, literally. Am sure that their WhatsApp groups buzzed with messages on what should be their best strategy on this topic. The line of argument they have chosen to bombard their readers/viewers is – Attack on Federalism! A long, pompous and gassy editorial was published in his newspaper, The Hindu (we will get it later in this article). N. Ram showed utmost humility and described his editorial as “clear-sighted and insightful”. A former CEO of The Hindu group of publications, Rajiv C. Lochan, dared to call out this humility of N.Ram on Twitter here (“Beware when one pats one’s own back”. He went on to comment that “the pervasive use of adjectives can’t strengthen a relatively weak set of arguments”. Rajiv Lochan was telling N. Ram that just because he used good English doesn’t mean that this editorial is insightful. Now, the unparalleled arrogance of N. Ram is well known. Occasionally he takes it upon himself to prove it yet again to all his readers. Rajiv Lochan provided the best opportunity for N. Ram to exhibit his famed arrogance and intolerance in public. True to his image, N. Ram use a lot of English words to convey a simple meaning. I would urge you to read the image below and have a hearty laugh at N. Ram’s meltdown! He is telling Rajiv Lochan that a mere CEO should shut up because there is no one better than N.Ram to have opinions in this whole world. How can a mere CEO comment in public about matters as trivial as Article 370? Imagine N. Ram’s attitude towards mere citizens if he goes bombastic like this on his former CEO! After reading the “clear-sighted and insightful” editorial about 3 to 5 times, I was able to find 2 sentences that summarized the arguments of the entire English media gang. The title of the editorial makes it sound like doomsday is near and we will die because of what the Supreme Court did! I have highlighted the relevant portion in the editorial that tells us that Parliament can now do anything while keeping a state under the President’s rule. This was what his compatriots at The Wire were also shrieking about. The meltdown at The Wire was even more monumental in proportions. Multiple opinion pieces popped up in a short time – all telling us the same thing – that there is no difference left between “democracy and dictatorship”; that there are “Serious implications” for the entire country; that this is an “attack on the basic structure of federalism”; and the best of all – Many “locals had feared” that they have been pushed into “meaningful silence”!Think about what these people are writing folks. What is wrong with “meaningful silence”? What is wrong with anything that is classified as “meaningful”? How can you use the word “meaningful” as a consequence of having “fear” to want it? N.Ram, Siddarth Varadarajan and their ilk know very well that the Parliament can split or not split a state even when there is an elected government in place and the legislature wishes otherwise. When she was the CM of UP, Mayawati passed a resolution in the UP Assembly asking the centre to split into 4 states. The then Home Minister flatly rejected the resolution. The disastrous manner in which AP was split into TS and AP is still fresh in many minds. The AP Legislature resolved that the state should not be split. Did that stop Sonia Gandhi from taking a stand otherwise? Examples galore exist on this topic. Starting from 1956 when their hero Nehru suspended the first elected communist government in the world in Kerala using a “brute majority” in Parliament. We can further discuss the language of Articles 1,2 and 3 in the Constitution of India. It wouldn’t serve any purpose for these people. We are approaching 10 years of Modi government. Despite their wonderful knowledge of the English language, these editors and owners have not been able to find new words, in the past 10 years, to describe their contempt towards the people of India for electing Modi. By rehashing the same words, and in the garb of being “insightful” and “clear-sighted”, all that these people have succeeded in was to show us how blinded they are to the reality of a new emerging Bharat. A Bharat that will embrace all meaningful decisions and leave behind all the meaningless trash these people dish out every day. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"13 December, 2023 ","As TV reporters shamelessly fight for smoke canister thrown in Parliament, here are a few things we should all be worried about after witnessing...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/journalists-fight-colour-canister-parliament-few-things-we-should-be-worried-about/,"If one truly thinks about it, the current TV journalists are merely following the standards set by veteran journalists like Rajdeep Sardesai who admitted that they were like vultures. On the 13th of December 2023, there was a serious security breach in the Parliament of India. Two individuals hurled a smoke canister from the viewer gallery. They then jumped to the floor of the house and were trying to make their way towards the speaker when were overpowered by parliamentarians. Thereafter they were detained by the police and taken for interrogation. Just as the security breach took place, there were two individuals outside the parliament protesting with similar colour smoke canisters. According to preliminary information from the Delhi Police, there is no terror angle to the incidents, however, the police are taking the breach seriously. According to reports, the intruder inside the parliament was chanting slogans about “Kaala Kanoon” and the protestors outside the Parliament were chanting slogans like Jai Bhim, Tanashahi Nahi Chalegi, Manipur ko Insaf do, etc. While the country was shocked by the serious security breach and the ramifications of the lapse, Indian media was conducting their very own circus. A video emerged where TV journalists were seen fighting like animals over the smoke canister that was hurled by the protestors. In the video put out by TV9, their journalist was showing the smoke canister on camera. While he was doing his segment, other journalists started trying to snatch the canister saying that he had used it enough and should hand over the canister to other journalists. When the other journalists started trying to snatch the canister, the TV9 journalist was seen almost sprinting with it, trying to get a few more seconds with the canister – for the sake of the hard-hitting coverage of the unfolding incident at the Parliament. As the nation had important questions that the media should have been focussing on – like how this security breach took place, who were the intruders, what were they chanting, why they did what they did, what was the police doing and how visitors entered the parliament with canisters and why were the Delhi Police so lackadaisical in arrested the protestors outside the Parliament, almost looking like they were taking them for a walk, these elements in the media seemed far more interested in ridiculous sensationalism and showing visuals of the canister. While we watched this circus unfold, there are several important aspects that people need to be extremely worried about. First and foremost, one has to wonder about the priorities of the media and what they choose to cover when important events unfold. As mentioned, there are very important questions that need to be answered as this security breach unfolds. The Parliament is not just a building but a symbol of the democracy of India and the seat of power. Any attack on the Parliament is an attack on democracy and the sovereignty of India itself. While these events unfolded, the journalists on the ground should have been far more focused on bringing crucial details to the people of the nation. And while several journalists were doing so, some were indulging in cheap sensationalism. This, however, comes as no surprise. One is reminded of the time when Rajdeep Sardesai was talking about the 2001 Parliament Attack – the terrorist attack that incidentally took place on this day 22 years ago. In 2018, a video had gone viral where Rajdeep Sardesai admitted that journalists were vultures. Sardesai in the video recounted the December 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament where he and his crew were preparing for a picnic owing to a slow news day. Preparing for a feast in the garden near the Parliament, he and his team entered the Parliament at around 11 am. Within minutes of the team entering the Parliament, he says they heard gunshots. The Parliament was attacked. He then recalled that when his colleague asked him to leave, he directed him to suggest the guard to close the gates. He explained with a wide grin that he did so so that no other channel crew could enter. Those days there were fewer channels and Sardesai was excited at the prospect of doing an exclusive story.He then says how the exclusive story of the parliament attack made the team forget the wine and kababs they were planning to picnic on. “It was a great day. We are like vultures. We feed on these moments.” he added.If one truly thinks about it, the current TV journalists are merely following the standards set by veteran vultures like Rajdeep Sardesai. While the conduct of the media was abysmal, what is far more concerning is the conduct of the Delhi Police and security agencies. When a security breach like this has taken place, one would imagine that the police and law enforcement agencies would ask the media to stand back – after all, 26/11 was a classic case of how the media could potentially jeopardise any rescue operation and investigation when such incidents take place. During the Mumbai Attack, the police allowed unbridled access to the media, resulting in journalists like Barkha Dutt potentially giving away crucial information on hostages from ISI handlers who were closely monitoring the media. Taking a lesson from the past, the police should have summarily kept the media away. That canister itself could be crucial evidence that the police need, instead, the media was yet again given unbridled access to play with the canister as if were some sort of a prop in a drama. On the 22nd anniversary of the ghastly 2001 Parliament attack, the parliament was under severe threat. There were Khalistani and other terror organisations which had issued threats against the Parliament. While now the police are claiming that the smoke was not harmful, while the breach was ongoing, the police had to function under the assumption that it could be a deadly terror attack which could have dire ramifications. Despite that, the media was given unbridled access knowing fully well that such media has a history of creating a circus during serious incidents. Several other questions are being raised against the police as the Parliament’s security was breached. Visitors to the Parliament are frisked at every stage and there are now questions being asked as to how the security could have been so wanting that two individuals with smoke canisters could enter the Parliament. Per protocol, those who have passes to view the Parliament proceedings are not allowed to carry a paper inside the Parliament. Legitimate concerns are now being raised as to how, amid such tight security, two individuals could enter with these canisters. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"11 December, 2023 ",Chadar of sanitised history over ugly side of ‘Sufi saints’: I got death threats by Islamists for talking about historical facts – so let...,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/nupur-j-sharma-moinuddin-chisti-sufi-saints-demand-arrest-threats-statement/,"Since the Islamists have been relentlessly demanding my arrest, I must place on record that if needed, I will be more than willing to defend my position in a court of law.On the 2nd of December, I interviewed the Son of Hamas – Mosab Hassan Yousef. He is the son of one of the founders of Hamas Sheikh Hassan Yousef. The interview was necessitated after a Hindu boy from Kashmir started getting Sar Tan Se Juda threats after he shared an old interview snippet of Yousef, where he was talking about Islam. After the boy from NIT Srinagar was threatened by the Islamist mob, Yousef took to his X page and posted that the Jihadis should go after him and leave the boy alone. In his interview with me, he categorically said that if anyone touched the Hindu boy, the repercussions would be dire. Beyond the NIT Srinagar case, Yousef and I also spoke at length about Islam, Islamism and the fate of the rest of the world in the face of a cult that was perpetually offended and believed that the use of violence to express that offence was their divine right – nay – duty. During the discussion, Yousef mentioned how Sufism was one of the most peaceful, spiritual branches of Islam. A Hindu, however, knows that this statement rings hollow. I told Yousef that as a Hindu, I find it difficult to make sense of that perception since Hindus have been raped and murdered by Sufis. As an example of the Sufi onslaught against Hindus, I cited the example of Moinuddin Chisti, how cows were slaughtered and Hindu Temples desecrated and also alluded to the Ajmer Dargah rape scandal where the self-proclaimed descendants of Moinuddin Chisti and the custodians of his legacy raped hundreds of Hindu girls and blackmailed them – a sordid saga from 1992. It is pertinent to mention here that I don’t blame Mosab Hassan Yousef for the views he holds on Sufism. Many Hindus themselves believe that Sufism is peaceful and spiritual. In fact, a chunk of the business that the Amer Dargah gets is from Hindus who visit the shrine – not Muslims. Even though it was some of the Chistis associated with the Ajmer Dargah who had issued death threats to Nupur Sharma and called for her beheading. Khadim Gauhar Chishti of Ajmer Dargah had links to Kanhaiya Lal’s murder. Khadim of Ajmer Dargah named Gauhar Chishti had met one of the killers of the Hindu tailor. Ajmer Dargah Khadim Salman Chishti threatened to kill Nupur Sharma. The history-sheeter with over 13 cases filed against him, including murder and attempt to murder, claimed that he would hand over his house to anyone who brings Sharma’s head. Sarwar Chishti of the Anjuman Committee of the Ajmer dargah had said “The situation in the country right now, is such that people are committing blasphemy. They are doing mischief in the glory of the Prophet, in the glory of the Khwaja. We will not tolerate this at all. We will launch such a massive agitation that the whole Hindustan will shake.” Sarwar Chishti had called himself a member of the PFI. In 2020, he defended PFI saying the organisation was ”saving India’s constitution”. He had also called for a boycott of Hindus. Syed Aadil Chishti – son of Sarwar Chishti – mocked Hindu deities after the Nupur Sharma incident.Nothing I said was historically inaccurate and I will come to that. Days after the interview, a clip where I mentioned Moinuddin Chisti was shared on social media by Islamists, claiming that I had insulted the Sufi ‘saint’ and I should be arrested. What started with the hashtag #ArrestNupurJSharma soon turned into a free-for-all – I got death threats, rape threats and the usual ‘Sar Tan se Juda’ threats. My reaction was the chuckle at the irony of it all. After all, my statement came just as it was being claimed that Sufis are peaceful and spiritual – a model for all Muslims to follow. Here is a sneak peak into their spiritual moorings: While the peaceful Sufis demanded for my head and arrest, I held my peace for 3 days – not because I was scared but because I believed that their outrage would die down. It did not. I believe sunlight is the best disinfectant. I believe the truth – historical facts – can’t be suppressed simply because some people are offended by it. As an American conservative says, ‘facts don’t care about your feelings’. I have repeated over and over again the purpose of my professional existence – I picked up my pen because ‘they’ sold theirs. I would not do justice to my role or my readers if I don’t stand by the truth. If I cower today. And therefore, I feel it necessary to substantiate my statement with historical evidence. With regards to Sufism, there is a broad perception that it is a peaceful, spiritual sect of Islam. However, there are certain myths attached to this notion that need honest conversation. Historically, several genocides against Hindus and crimes against their faith/places of worship have been led by Sufis or have been conducted at the behest of Sufis. It is a matter of historical record that eighteenth-century Sufi preacher Shah Waliullah’s letters to Islamic rulers and nobles show that he was very keen on rejuvenating Islamic supremacy in Delhi, which had started to loosen its grip over the sub-continent after Aurangzeb’s death. According to the book by Saiyid Athar Abbas Rizvi, Shah Waliullah wrote a letter to Ahmad Shah Abdali, the invader from Afghanistan, inviting him to India to establish Islamic supremacy by suppressing Hindus.From the invite to Ahmad Shah Abdali to the mastermind of the Noakhali genocide belonging to a Sufi sect – Shah Syed Gholam Sarwar Husseini, the hereditary pir of Dayra Sharif, a Sufi shrine in Noakhali, Sufism has a chequered history – one which is well documented – a history of genocide, enslavement, forced conversion and establishment of the supremacy of Islam. Those Sufis who refused to adhere to Orthodox Islam were persecuted – the sects we talk about today were not. MA Khan writes that Sufi leaders had poured into India along with the Turkic invaders and most of them, Nizamuddin Aulia, Aamir Khasrau, Nasiruddin Chiragh, Moinuddin Chishti and Jalaluddin etc, were all known for holding the Ulemas, orthodox Islamic scholars in high esteem. Khan further writes that though Nizamuddin Aulia and Moinuddin Chishti were among the most unorthodox when it came to music and dance, in the matters of Islam and Islamic supremacy, they held the words of the Ulema as sacrosanct. “What the Ulema seeks to achieve through speech, the Sufis achieve by behaviour,” Nizamuddin Aulia had said.The great Sufi saint Nasiruddin Chiragh had reportedly banned all practices that were deviant from the Sharia. Khan quotes Prof KA Nizami to describe what the Sufi leader Ghazzali had told in terms of Jihad, the Islamic religious war against Kafirs. Ghazzali had written that his followers must go on Jihad at least once a year and should bring down the fortresses of non-Muslims, they should cut down their throats drown them and burn their holy books. Jihadists may take whatever booty they desire. Toeing the orthodox line, Nizamuddin Aulia had condemned the Hindus of India to the ‘fires of hell’. He had also written that even if non-Muslims embrace Islam, the faith will not benefit them, because they had been unbelievers. He had added, “He, (Allah) has created paradise and hell for the believers and the infidels respectively to repay the wicked they (infidels) have done.” Now, coming to the specific comments in question about Moinuddin Chisti – one made during an interview with the Son of Hamas – Mosab Hassan Yousef. It is necessary to place on record that in the full video interview uploaded on YouTube, the mention of Moinuddin Chisti had long been redacted. Let me explain why. When I asked the question about Sufism and Hindus, I intended to talk about the campaign of certain Sufis against Hindus – which has been documented throughout history – even as recently as 1992. In the video description, I have explained that when I spoke of rape, I was referring to the Ajmer Dargah Rape scandal where hundreds of Hindu girls were raped with the active connivance and participation of the Khadims of Ajmer Dargah – the Chistis – who claim to be the descendants of Moinuddin Chisti. Farooq Chisti was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2007, but in 2013, the Rajasthan High Court deemed he had served ‘enough’ time and therefore, released him. The Ajmer Dargah still associates itself with him and his local clout has remained intact. Nafis Chist was absconding until 2003, before being caught by the Delhi Police while trying to escape, wearing a burqa. He is currently out on bail and respected in a similar way in Ajmer. These are facts. In the second part of the question, I spoke about cows being slaughtered and thrown into Hindu temples. I also spoke about the desecration of Hindu temples and the Jihad waged by Moinuddin Chisti – this assertion is again documented in history. Here is an excerpt from the book “Islamic Jihad” by MA Khan. Khan writes further that every day, Khwaja’s followers used to bring a cow and they used to slaughter it near a prominent temple where the local Raja and Hindus used to pray, cook kebabs from the cow’s meat to eat, just to show contempt towards the local Hindus. Chishti had come to India to fight Jihad on the side of the Sultan Muhammad Ghauri against the Hindu King Prithviraj Chauhan. Chishti had credited himself for Prithviraj’s capture, writing, “We have seized Pithaura (Prithviraj) and handed him to the army of Islam.” In addition, this is what a previous version of the website of Ajmer Dargah itself said and I quote, “When he had settled down in Ajmer, the Khawaja Sahib had a special reminder about his marriage through a ‘Basharat’ (prophetic dream) from the Holy prophet sometime in 590 AH or 1193 AD. The Prophet said, “O Moinuddin, You are a great preceptor of our religion. You should not depart from our ‘sunnah’ (meaning marriage which is incumbent upon every Muslim under the laws of Shariat). Coincidentally that very night Malik-a-Khitab devotee of Hazrat Khawaja Sahib, had captured a Raja’s daughter in an encounter who embraced Islam and Khawaja sahib, in response to the above reminder, married her giving her the Islamic name of Bibi Ummutulla..” Here is an archive link to the page: https://web.archive.org/web/20180319103851/http://dargahajmer.com/married-life/ This is also substantiated in A History Of Sufism in India, Sayyad Athar Abbas Rizvi, Vol 1, pg. 124. However, since the snippet in the video was not an explainer and merely a question, I realized it may be misinterpreted and therefore, the mention of the individual was removed. It bodes well, however, to repeat on record that I stand by the rest of my statement. Since the Islamists have been relentlessly demanding my arrest, I must place on record that if needed, I will be more than willing to defend my position in a court of law.It is said that the most effective way to destroy people is to deny and obliterate their own understanding of their history. For what little my contribution is worth, I refuse to be a part of that obliteration – I will not be silenced. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"10 December, 2023 ","Antisemitism is not new to US campuses including Ivy Leagues, their credibility is questionable for more reasons than one. Here’s why",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/antisemitism-not-new-to-us-campuses-their-credibility-questionable/,"While several academic institutes across America, both Ivy League and, public and private, saw a dramatic rise in hostility against Jewish students, these have turned out to be symptoms of an underlying disease.A mix of Georgian and Victorian-era inspired academic buildings are spread across the Northeastern United States. Besides the entitled exclusivity in the admissions process, the unreasonable fee structure and the decorated syllabus, there is also a sadistic appeal to the Gothic appearance these institutions boast of.But, to quote Shakespeare, all that glitters is not gold.The holier-than-thou attitude over the decades of US’s Ivy Leagues – touted as the world’s most esteemed and prestigious universities – was brought to its knees when presidents of two of the three universities, Harvard and Penn, and the third being the high-ranking MIT, refused to condemn calls for genocide of Jews at a congressional hearing on 5th December.On 5th December, a congressional hearing on “Holding Campus Leaders Accountable and Confronting Antisemitism” was held in Washington, D.C.At the hearing, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik confronted the Presidents of Harvard University, University of Pennsylvania and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).Her specific yes or no question to them was, “Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate your university’s rules or code of conduct regarding bullying or harassment?”MIT President Sally Kornbluth responded saying that “if targeted at individuals and not making public statements”. When asked for a yes or no answer, Kornbluth said that she has not heard calls for the genocide of Jews on MIT campus.The Congresswoman questioned, “But you have chants for intifada?” To this, Kornbluth replied, “I have heard chants which can be antisemitic depending on the context when calling for the elimination of the Jewish people.”She said that such calls would be investigated as harassment only “if pervasive and severe”.President (now former) of University of Pennsylvania, Liz Magill’s response came with wide smiles and smirks. She said, “If the speech turns into conduct it can be harassment, yes.”When questioned again, Magill said that if such speech is directed and severe and pervasive, it is harassment. When asked if she means a yes, Magill said it is a context-dependent decision.She maintained that “if the speech becomes conduct, it is harassment”. Magill finally responded with a yes after much struggle. President of Harvard, Dr Claudine Gay reiterated the same chorus in answer to the question.“It (the call for genocide of Jews) can be (violate rules) depending on the context,” Dr Gay said. When asked what the context is she said, “targeted as an individual, targeted at an individual.”“Antisemitic rhetoric when it crosses into conduct, it amounts to bullying, harassment, intimidation, that is actionable conduct and we do take action,” Dr Gay said.The roughly 3 minute 31 second long video of the hearing took social media by the storm prompting angry responses from netizens. The matter has escalated with key stakeholders demanding accountability from the presidents of the respective universities.President Liz Magill of University of Penn has resigned amid mounting pressure.The focus of the hearing by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce was the rise in cases of antisemitism reported on campuses across the US and the universities’ response to the same.This comes in the backdrop of the 7th October terrorist attack by Palestinian group Hamas on Israel killing at least 1,400 people and kidnapping more than 200 to Gaza. Israel has since vowed to avenge the death of its people and has launched an all-out offensive against the terrorist group.A selective support for Palestinians toeing the Hamas line has since mushroomed in campuses across the United States. In the name of human rights of Palestinians, the terrorist attack by Hamas on Israel has been justified on the campuses of these so-called prestigious institutions with absolutely no repercussions from the administration.On 11th October, four days after the brutal attack on Israel, a group of Harvard students submitted a letter in support of Palestine. This prompted several corporate institutions, particularly those with Jewish heads, warning Harvard that they will not hire students supporting Hamas. Several Jewish donors to the universities also threatened to withdraw their donations.On 25th October, Jewish students at Cooper Union college in New York had to be locked inside library for their own safety as pro-Palestinian students tried to break down the door chanting “Free Palestine”. The Jewish students had to be escorted out through tunnels using the back door.On 18th October, a “Stop the genocide in Gaza” die-in demonstration was reportedly organised by the Harvard Business School. A video from the demonstration showed a Jewish student mobbed by pro-Palestinian demonstrators screaming “shame, shame, shame”.On 24th October, an antisemitic slogan was displayed on the wall of the library of George Washington University. It read, “Free Palestine From The River To The Sea.” Another message read, “Glory to our martyrs” and one read, “End the siege on Gaza”.While several academic institutes across America, both Ivy League and, public and private, saw a dramatic rise in hostility against Jewish students, these have turned out to be symptoms of an underlying disease.A complaint letter via e-mail by the Jewish rights group ‘Brandeis Center’ to the University of Pennsylvania alleged that the latter had allowed its campus to become a hostile environment for Jewish students and a magnet for antisemites.It pointed to a festival that was organised by the university titled “Palestine Writes Festival” which hosted antisemitic speakers. Notably, this festival came days before the terrorist attacks proving the antisemitism is pre-existing sentiment on campuses in the US.The letter read, “In the days leading up to the September Festival, anti-Semitic graffiti and a Penn student’s violent attack on Penn’s Hillel signaled trouble to come for Jewish students and institutions on campus.”Surprisingly, the festival was organised on the same day as the Jewish festival ‘Jewish High Holy Days of Awe”. Meanwhile, Magill, despite concerns raised by several members, stood by the event citing “free speech”.Even now, as recently as 9th December (Saturday), Jewish students in the Penn University are being subjected to chants like “We are Hamas” whereas openly antisemitic professors and staff are still employed with the university.Forget even the recent decades, antisemitism on US campuses goes back nearly a century. In the 1950s, Stanford University reportedly tried to limit the proportion of its Jewish students.Stanford University is located on the West Coast of the US and is not an Ivy League university but ranks higher than Ivy League varsities.Another report reveals that the Seth Low Junior College (SLJC) near the Columbia University was “created with the explicit goal of reducing the amount of Jewish students on the CU campus”. It was built in the early 20th century.As per the report, the “enrollment of Jewish students at Columbia College after Seth Low Junior College’s opening dropped from 40 to 25 per cent”. Moreover, on one hand, half of the total Columbia College applicants were accepted, only one in six Jewish applicants were admitted in the early 20th century.This was reportedly the case in most East Coast schools in the US.One might think that on-campus antisemitism is an elephantine problem which dwarfs any other controversies surrounding academic campuses in America.Not really. The political invasion of campuses in America which is being exposed with hatred for Jews and Israel has only compounded their already declining credibility.The larger-than-life projected image of these institutions in the US has been a facade which has been maintained through endowments, donations and charities flowing in like dirt, open political biases, crippling admissions fees thereby giving academic access to only a handful, racial and gender persecution, and woke agendas.You’d be surprised, if not shocked, to know that it was only in June this year that the US Supreme Court ruled that universities can no longer determine race as grounds for admissions.Up till the US SC verdict, race was still very much a part of the admissions process in the United States centered around the idea of “positive discrimination”.And yet, the move was decried by the left-liberal media in the US as the end of “affirmative action”.Racism has been rampant, like a regular petty crime, on US campuses including the so-called esteemed campuses. This has only served to fan left wing politics in the US where voices are raised prominently when incidents involve a black victim.But when Asian or Indian students are subjected to racism, the same woke left wing crowd goes into hiding. Safe to say, US campuses are not merely dealing with crimes of unabated racism but several politicised versions of it.In 2020, Princeton University had acknowledged that systemic racism exists on its campus following which an investigation was launched by the Trump administration.Columbia University graduate Emma Sulkowicz made headlines in 2015 by staging a protest based on performance art against alleged sexual harassment.Sulkowicz walked around the campus carrying a 50-pound mattress and across the stage during her graduation to symbolise the weight carried around by victims of sexual assault.She had alleged that she was sexually assaulted by a classmate of rape during her sophomore year in 2013. The accused was cleared of the charges following a hearing by the university.In 2017, three professors in Dartmouth’s department of psychological and brain sciences were accused of sexual abuse and misconduct. The professors reportedly resigned or retired following recommendations for dismissal.However, the seven women who levelled the charges alleged that the college had failed to protect its students from sexual harassment and sexual assault.A scandal broke out in Cornell University last year exposing alleged incidents of sexual assault and druggings at off-campus fraternity parties. A crime alert was issued early in November 2022 by the campus police responding to four different reports of students being drugged and at least once case of sexual assault.In May 2022, a longtime professor at Princeton named Joshua Katz was suspended after investigation revealed that he had sex with one of his undergraduate students years ago.In 2021, several complaints surfaced against the professor from mid-2000s alleging disturbing cases of allegedly propositioning undergraduates for sexual relationships.In 1986, a shocking scandal was uncovered in Brown University wherein students were allegedly linked to a sex worker ring in Providence. Multiple students were charged with sex work crimes and drug possession.According to The Washington Post, Harvard in 2022 warned all undergraduate students that “cisheterosexism,” “fatphobia” and “using the wrong pronouns” amounted to “abuse” and perpetuated “violence” on campus.In May this year, the student government at the Northwestern University in Illinois “indefinitely” froze the funds of the College Republicans over an event poster showing conservative speaker James Lindsay, critical of transgenderism.After an uproar that has been dragging in the US over participation of trans athletes in women’s sports, a bill was approved by the House Republicans in April this year barring such transgender athletes whose biological sex awas assigned at birth as male from competing on girls’ or women’s sports teams.As if the use of a thousand pronouns for individually-preferred “gender” identification has not disadvantaged academically-focused students enough, transgenders participating against females in sports has most definitely put the latter at a physical disadvantage.High-profile names involving celebrities and politicians and their aides were at the center of a massive admissions scandal across universities.College athletics coaches and test administrators accepted bribes and donations in exchange for recruiting students. The mastermind, William Rick Singer, was paid a whopping $25 million by celebrity parents to bribe coaches and university administrators to designate their children as purported athletic recruits to facilitate their admission.Singer allegedly created fake charities to facilitate money for “donations” to various colleges including Yale University, Georgetown, Stanford and the University of Southern California.The big names involved in the scandal include Lori Loughlin, Felicity Huffman, Mossimo Giannulli, William H Macy, Michelle Janavs and many more. One of the more prominent names is Gordon Ernst, former Georgetown University tennis coach known for having coached the Obamas.In 2022, a professor at Columbia University, Michael Thaddeus, published a paper accusing the varsity of manipulating data to project that it spent more on research and instruction than it actually did.This, reportedly, in turn is suspected to have played a role in the Ivy League institution’s jump in the rankings. The university later admitted that they had reported incorrect data but refused to admit that it was done to improve rankings.As per the professor’s report, the varsity’s rankings moved up from no. 18 in 1988 to no 2 by 2022. Following the controversy, Columbia, Yale and Harvard announced that they would no longer participate in the rankings in the future.The rise of wokeism on university campuses in US can easily be attributed to left-wing bias. In fact, it can be considered a branch of the same tree.According to a poll, Republicans have the least amount of confidence (19%) in higher education in the United States whereas Democrats have the highest level of confidence at 59%.Another related survey reportedly found that 77% of college presidents in the US agree that the perception of colleges as intolerant of conservative views has impacted people’s attitudes about higher education.According to a report, US universities have been receiving funding from Qatar particularly in the period between 2001 and 2021, “precisely after the September 11 attacks”.As per the report based on a study published in 2022, a staggering $4.7 billion was injected into universities in the United States. Moreover, the recipients did not report part of the money received as required by the law.“Qatar has reportedly become the largest foreign donor to American academic in the two decades since 9/11,” the report reads.In 2020, the Trump administration alleged that top US universities have “massively underreported” foreign funding from China, Russia and other nations described as “foreign adversaries”.According to another report, Saudi Arabia owned oil company ARAMCO has been funding programmes in US universities like Princeton since as early as the 1950s. Moreover, Middle East studies programme in US institutions reportedly receive specifically from Arab countries to “advance their political agendas”.“I don’t think there’s any doubt that the Saudis have seen such donations as a way to acquire goodwill, legitimacy and support in U.S. academia,” the report quotes NYU professor Zachary Lockman. Interestingly, it must be noted that some of the biggest names like George Soros and the Rothschilds, which bestow donations in billions to the US acadmia, are Jewish. And it is thus a wonder as to how these institutions, funded equally well by the left-liberal globalist disruptors like their Middle Eastern counterparts, have been unable to counter antisemitism. Yet, when questions are raised against these conglomerates, they coin the term antisemitism through their rights groups and NGOs in their defence.All in all, Universities in the US are too good to be true for their realities have been exposed for all to see since a long time. It is time to stop trusting every colonial infrastructure just because they put on a good show of elitist exclusivity. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"7 December, 2023 ","How The Hindu consoled itself and shielded Rahul Gandhi after electoral drubbing in 3 states: Blaming regional leaders, voters, Hindutva and more",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/the-hindu-shields-rahul-gandhi-electoral-loss-3-states-regional-leaders-voters-hindutva/,"The Gandhi family must realise how faithful the editors and owners of The Hindu are towards them and make such great efforts to make them look good. The effort the writers at The Hindu put up in finding new phrases and words to describe their disgust towards the voters is praiseworthy! By now, we are all used to the Congress party leaders crediting the Gandhi family for victories and blaming the regional leaders for their defeats. It is understandable why they are forced to do this. However, it is baffling that certain newspapers, that claim to be brave, daring, unbiased and whatnot, also willingly resorted to this same argument. Just to shield the Gandhi family.The Congress party lost in Rajasthan (RJ), Madhya Pradesh (MP) and Chhattisgarh (CG) in the just concluded elections to these states. The Hindu, in a great show of loyalty towards the Gandhi family, asks us – Did overconfident regional leaders in the Hindi heartland pay no heed to Congress top brass?We are told by the author that in these three states, “heavyweights took independent decisions often ignoring the high command”. Are we to seriously believe there are people in Congress who are capable of ignoring the Gandhi family and making decisions? The author cites the example of Kamal Nath cancelling an I.N.D.I Alliance meeting in Bhopal. Are we to believe that Rahul Gandhi had no role in the cancellation of such a meeting? However, in my opinion, the best argument by the author was about the CG election. He writes that “Though the AICC did replace over 20 MLAs to beat anti-incumbency, Mr Baghel could not effectively counter the allegations of corruption against his government by the BJP”. Cute, no? The Gandhi family thought their job ended with replacing MLAs. The job of winning the narrative is on the CM only though. Imagine if Congress had won. The same author would have written how the Gandhi family played a master stroke by replacing 20 MLAs! This article is not the only place where The Hindu has given us pearls of wisdom. Their editorial on the results of these elections was even better! We have been told that the victory was because the BJP’s campaign was “laced with communal propaganda” and therefore “had a more effective outreach to subaltern segments”. I like the choice of phrase – subaltern segments. It’s a posh way of insulting the intelligence of the voters. In this particular case, The Hindu is arguing that the voter chose BJP’s communal agenda over Congress’s caste agenda. In its entire (long) editorial, The Hindu makes no mention of governance-based reasons on why the voters were vexed with Congress in RJ and CG where it was in power; and why they didn’t see Congress as an alternative in MP where BJP has been in power for nearly 2 decades now. We are told that Ashok Gehlot is so awesome that even though he lost the election he prevented a complete washout! And just in case you forgot that they told you that the BJP won because of Hindutva, they repeat it once again in their (long) editorial. This time, they accuse women, youth and tribal communities of falling prey to “Hindu identity politics”. I wonder what wrong the men did, to not get this honour! The editorial is severely upset that the caste census idea of Rahul Gandhi did not resonate with the voters. The editorial takes up a lot of space and conveys very little. When you separate the wheat from the chaff, it is baffling how The Hindu always ends up arguing that BJP’s victories are always because of Hindutva and nothing else really matters. How they try to find solace in the performance of the Congress party is also very touching. Their front-page banner story also highlighted how despite losing, they had their vote share intact! I hope the Gandhi family realises how faithful the editors and owners of The Hindu are towards them and make such great efforts to make them look good. The effort the writers at The Hindu put up in finding new phrases and words to describe their disgust towards the voters is really praiseworthy! They have been resorting to the same argument ever since the 2014 Lok Sabha victory changed the political landscape of India. It’s been more than 9 years, but they are yet to get out of the shock! Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"14 December, 2023 ","News24 posts misleading tweet on Muslim sculptors making idol of Ram Lalla, here are the facts on the idols being made for the Ram...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/news24-posts-misleading-tweet-on-muslim-sculptors-making-idol-of-ram-lalla/,"While Muslim sculptor Jamaluddin and his son are making fibre statues of Lord Ram for decorative purposes, News24 claimed they are making Ram Lalla idol to be placed in Ram MandirAs the date for grand opening of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya approaches, various updates about the temple are being reported by the media. However, misleading and fake news are also being published by some media houses regarding the Ram Mandir. One such false information was provided by News24, which claimed that the idol of Ram Lalla to be installed in the temple is being made by a Muslim sculptor and his son.On 14th December, News24 posted a tweet on X, claiming that Muhammad Jamaluddin from West Bengal and his son Bittu are sculpting the idol of Ram Lalla, which will take its place in the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. The tweet in Hindi said, “Ramlalla is ready to sit in the Ram temple of Ayodhya in January.” After that, the media houses added four bullet points, the first of which said, “The idols were made by Mohammad Jamaluddin of Bengal and his son Bittu.”News24 then said in the post that father-son duo has been crafting idols for a long time. The post then added remarks by Jamaluddin, who said, ‘Religion is a personal thing. People following many religions live in our country. The culture of brotherhood is my message as an artiste.’By saying that Jamaluddin and his son are making the idol of Ram Lall to be placed in Ram Mandir, News24 implied that the Muslim duo is making the main idol to placed in the sanctum sanctorum of the temple. But this is completely fake and misleading claim, and no Muslim is making the main idol of Ram Lalla.In fact, other media reports on Jamaluddin make it clear that he is making a decorating idol using fibre for the opening ceremony of Ram Mandir. As per a report by India Today, Mohammed Jamaluddin and his son Bittu have been engaged in creating some statues that will adorn the temple complex. The report stated that he is making life-size fibre statues.Other reports make it clear that the fibre statutes of Lord Ram and other Gods will be used to decorate the temple complex and the Ayodhya City during the inauguration ceremony. TV9 reported that statues of Lord Ram will be placed in major intersections in Ayodhya, and some of these idols are being made by Jamaluddin and his son.After several social media users pointed out the misleading claim made by News24, the media house later deleted the tweet.Fibre idols are generally used for decorative purposes, and they are not used as the main deity in temples. Most deities in Hindu temples are made from various types of stones, while temporary idols made for annual festivals are made using clay. Fibre idols last longer than clay, but are much easier to make compared to carving stone. Fibre idols are generally made for export, as they are lighter and easy to transport with the risk of damage. Notably, not one but three idols of Ram Lalla are being made in Ayodhya by three separate artists, and one of them will be picked by a committee to be placed in Sanctum Santorum, after which the pran pratistha rituals will be conducted by priests. Champat Rai, general secretary of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Trust, had earlier informed that the three different idols are being made by three sculptors – Ganesh Bhatt and Arun Yogiraj from Karnataka and Satyanarayan Pandey from Jaipur. Two of the idols are being made using two stones from Karnataka and one from Rajasthan. Earlier, a stone was brought from Nepal, and later stones were also brought from Odisha and Maharashtra to carve the idol, but those were found not suitable.Ganesh Bhatt of Karnataka is carving out the idol from Nellikaru rock or black stones which is also known as Shyam shila or Krishna shila. Famous sculptor Arun Yogiraj of Mysore, who sculpted the 12-ft statue of Adi Shankaracharya unveiled by PM Modi in Kedarnath, is sculpting another idol using another rock from Karnataka. Satya Narayan Pandey of Rajasthan is carving the Ram Lalla idol from white Makrana marble stones. All three artists are chiselling the idols based on a sketch by renowned artist Vasudeo Kamath from Mumbai.The 51-inch-tall Ram Lalla depicts the child form of Lord Ram, same as the current smaller idol that was placed in the makeshift temple for over half a century. The idol will depict five-year-old Ram Lalla sitting on a lotus, carrying a bow in one hand and an arrow in the other. Many other symbols related to Lord Ram will carved on the statue.While one idol will be selected to be permanently placed in the sanctum sanctorum, the other two idols will be placed in prominent places inside the temple premises.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"22 November, 2023 ","No, Shakib Al Hasan wasn’t beaten up on his return to Bangladesh after the World Cup: Here’s the truth about the viral video",https://www.opindia.com/2023/11/shakib-al-hasan-wasnt-beaten-up-on-his-return-to-bangladesh-after-world-cup-truth-about-the-viral-video/,"An old video of Bangladeshi cricketer Shakib Al-Hasan being beaten up and shoved around is going viral on social media with the claim that the all-rounder had been pushed around on his return to Bangladesh after the World Cup. In the wake of Bangladesh’s poor performance in the World Cup 2023, a video of Shakib Al Hasan being pulled, and thrashed by a mob is going viral on the internet. It is being claimed that the Bangladeshi Captain Shakib was mobbed by angry Bangladeshi fans on his return to the country. The viral video was also shared by some media portals claiming that the Bangladeshi skipper was ‘brutally beaten’/ ‘assaulted’ after the team’s World Cup debacle.  Kalesh b/w Bangladeshi Fans and Shakib al hasan, when he returned to Bangladesh after poor World Cup campaign  pic.twitter.com/C7DQK93gAkThis happened to Shakib when he returned to Bangladesh after poor World Cup campaign Bangladeshi people are top tier ret@rds https://t.co/iFDogEkZCA pic.twitter.com/xKkkyfmLFRJournalist Anil Tiwari who writes for Qatari mouthpiece Aljazeera, as per his Twitter bio, tweeted, “Bangladeshi fans assaulted their captain Shakib Al Hasan. Just yesterday, they were celebrating India’s defeat. Utterly disgraceful behaviour.”Bangladeshi fans assaulted their captain Shakib Al Hasan. Just yesterday, they were celebrating India's defeat. Utterly disgraceful behavior. #CricketWorldCup #Cricket #Bangladesh  pic.twitter.com/bYY9Cn6xBSHere are some headlines from media portals making those claims alongside sharing the viral video. A Cricket portal named OneCricket headlined (Archive) “[Watch] Shakib Al Hasan Gets ‘Brutally Beaten’ By Bangladesh Fans After Horrific World Cup Run”Notably, Bangladesh performed badly and finished in the eighth spot in the recently concluded World Cup, falling way below the fans’ expectations. The Shakib Al Hasan-led side only managed to win 2 games and the skipper himself had an unforgettable outing. He had to bench himself in some games due to injury concerns. However, the claims being made on the basis of the viral videos are fake. The video doing rounds on the internet is an old video. The said incident involving Shakib Al Hasan captured in the video took place in March this year, that is the video is 8 months old. It is not linked with Bangladesh’s poor performance at the World Cup or Shakib’s below-per-performance. Additionally, the Bangladeshi skipper was not assaulted or mobbed on his return to the country after the team’s World Cup debacle, as claimed on the internet.  The incident took place in Dubai on 16th March when Shakib Al Hasan went for a commercial event at a Jewelry store. After his series against England in March this year, Shakib flew to Dubai to inaugurate a gold jewelry shop that was owned by Arav Khan. Khan is a Bangladeshi fugitive and wanted in the murder case of a police official.At the time of the incident, Shakib was surrounded by fans who went out of control and he tried to rush out. However, in the chaos, he almost fell over while fans kept pulling his collar to stop him and take selfies with him. As seen from the video and confirmed by media reports of that time, he had no security around him to keep fans in check.   Regarding the Dubai incident involving Shakib, the Additional commissioner (detective) of Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) told the media that the man (Robiul Islam) who uploaded the video is from Bangladesh. The Police official added that Islam had murdered a police officer and had taken an Indian passport. He noted that the accused then went on to live in Dubai and despite knowing his criminal past Shakib went to his event. It is important to note here that Arav Khan’s original name is Robiul Islam. He hails from Kotalipara in Gopalganj and fled the country after charges of murder.The officer added that as part of the investigation, the Bangladeshi Cricket team’s captain might also be quizzed. Sharing reports and details of the original incident, several Twitter users called out the fake claims being made about Shakib Al Hasan. The users slammed individuals and media outlets for peddling these false claims, particularly those who connected the recent setback for Bangladesh with an older video depicting fans pulling his shirt, falsely portraying it as a case of him being manhandled or assaulted while attempting to take a selfie. This footage from Dubai in purposes of business and the audio was taken from a tv DramaOld news pic.twitter.com/NTb3uviioDFAKE NEWS BUSTED !! #ShakibAlHasanhttps://t.co/W7lwtlO2TaI hope you recover from the hated of your own bitrthland.Fake voice alertThis is a 8 months old video from dubai.where he went for promotion and fans wanted to take it photo with him.Crowd went out of control.Such a disgusting thing that it is morphed by a Bangladeshi Kohli fan pic.twitter.com/89qzTQvfsfSome users accused that the fake claims were peddled by Kohli fans in Bangladesh.

"14 December, 2023 ","News24 posts misleading tweet on Muslim sculptors making idol of Ram Lalla, here are the facts on the idols being made for the Ram...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/news24-posts-misleading-tweet-on-muslim-sculptors-making-idol-of-ram-lalla/,"While Muslim sculptor Jamaluddin and his son are making fibre statues of Lord Ram for decorative purposes, News24 claimed they are making Ram Lalla idol to be placed in Ram MandirAs the date for grand opening of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya approaches, various updates about the temple are being reported by the media. However, misleading and fake news are also being published by some media houses regarding the Ram Mandir. One such false information was provided by News24, which claimed that the idol of Ram Lalla to be installed in the temple is being made by a Muslim sculptor and his son.On 14th December, News24 posted a tweet on X, claiming that Muhammad Jamaluddin from West Bengal and his son Bittu are sculpting the idol of Ram Lalla, which will take its place in the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. The tweet in Hindi said, “Ramlalla is ready to sit in the Ram temple of Ayodhya in January.” After that, the media houses added four bullet points, the first of which said, “The idols were made by Mohammad Jamaluddin of Bengal and his son Bittu.”News24 then said in the post that father-son duo has been crafting idols for a long time. The post then added remarks by Jamaluddin, who said, ‘Religion is a personal thing. People following many religions live in our country. The culture of brotherhood is my message as an artiste.’By saying that Jamaluddin and his son are making the idol of Ram Lall to be placed in Ram Mandir, News24 implied that the Muslim duo is making the main idol to placed in the sanctum sanctorum of the temple.

"14 December, 2023 ","N Ram pats his own back for a pompous, gassy editorial in The Hindu, The Wire has a monumental meltdown: Fallout of SC decision...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/n-ram-pompous-editorial-the-hindu-the-wire-meltdown-sc-decision-article-370/,"N.Ram, Siddarth Varadarajan and their ilk know very well that the Parliament can split or not split a state even when there is an elected government in place and the legislature wishes otherwise.On December 11th, the Supreme Court upheld the abolition of the dreaded Article 370 (I know it was repealed and therefore while Article 370 still exists in the Constitution, the original dreaded purpose for which it was intended doesn’t exist anymore). Certain sections of the English media; certain sections of the I.N.D.I alliance and the entire Congress party went bonkers over this decision of the Supreme Court. Watching their meltdowns gave me goosebumps, literally. Am sure that their WhatsApp groups buzzed with messages on what should be their best strategy on this topic. The line of argument they have chosen to bombard their readers/viewers is – Attack on Federalism! A long, pompous and gassy editorial was published in his newspaper, The Hindu (we will get it later in this article). N. Ram showed utmost humility and described his editorial as “clear-sighted and insightful”. A former CEO of The Hindu group of publications, Rajiv C. Lochan, dared to call out this humility of N.Ram on Twitter here (“Beware when one pats one’s own back”. He went on to comment that “the pervasive use of adjectives can’t strengthen a relatively weak set of arguments”. Rajiv Lochan was telling N. Ram that just because he used good English doesn’t mean that this editorial is insightful. Now, the unparalleled arrogance of N. Ram is well known. Occasionally he takes it upon himself to prove it yet again to all his readers. Rajiv Lochan provided the best opportunity for N. Ram to exhibit his famed arrogance and intolerance in public. True to his image, N. Ram use a lot of English words to convey a simple meaning. I would urge you to read the image below and have a hearty laugh at N. Ram’s meltdown! He is telling Rajiv Lochan that a mere CEO should shut up because there is no one better than N.Ram to have opinions in this whole world. How can a mere CEO comment in public about matters as trivial as Article 370? Imagine N. Ram’s attitude towards mere citizens if he goes bombastic like this on his former CEO! After reading the “clear-sighted and insightful” editorial about 3 to 5 times, I was able to find 2 sentences that summarized the arguments of the entire English media gang. The title of the editorial makes it sound like doomsday is near and we will die because of what the Supreme Court did! I have highlighted the relevant portion in the editorial that tells us that Parliament can now do anything while keeping a state under the President’s rule. This was what his compatriots at The Wire were also shrieking about. The meltdown at The Wire was even more monumental in proportions. Multiple opinion pieces popped up in a short time – all telling us the same thing – that there is no difference left between “democracy and dictatorship”; that there are “Serious implications” for the entire country; that this is an “attack on the basic structure of federalism”; and the best of all – Many “locals had feared” that they have been pushed into “meaningful silence”!Think about what these people are writing folks. What is wrong with “meaningful silence”? What is wrong with anything that is classified as “meaningful”? How can you use the word “meaningful” as a consequence of having “fear” to want it? N.Ram, Siddarth Varadarajan and their ilk know very well that the Parliament can split or not split a state even when there is an elected government in place and the legislature wishes otherwise. When she was the CM of UP, Mayawati passed a resolution in the UP Assembly asking the centre to split into 4 states. The then Home Minister flatly rejected the resolution. The disastrous manner in which AP was split into TS and AP is still fresh in many minds. The AP Legislature resolved that the state should not be split. Did that stop Sonia Gandhi from taking a stand otherwise? Examples galore exist on this topic. Starting from 1956 when their hero Nehru suspended the first elected communist government in the world in Kerala using a “brute majority” in Parliament. We can further discuss the language of Articles 1,2 and 3 in the Constitution of India. It wouldn’t serve any purpose for these people. We are approaching 10 years of Modi government. Despite their wonderful knowledge of the English language, these editors and owners have not been able to find new words, in the past 10 years, to describe their contempt towards the people of India for electing Modi. By rehashing the same words, and in the garb of being “insightful” and “clear-sighted”, all that these people have succeeded in was to show us how blinded they are to the reality of a new emerging Bharat. A Bharat that will embrace all meaningful decisions and leave behind all the meaningless trash these people dish out every day. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"14 December, 2023 ",‘Parliament me toh apne hi log gaye hain’: Leftist journalist Anil Sinha supports the accused in parliament security breach case,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/parliament-me-toh-apne-hi-log-gaye-hain-leftist-journalist-anil-sinha-parliament-security-breach-case/,"By calling the parliament intruders 'Apne Hi Log', Anil Sinha essentially meant that they belonged to the same ideology as him. He also lauded them for raising the same issues in the parliament which he claimed he was discussing in the debates.On Wednesday (13th December), the leftist-liberal YouTube channel Satya Hindi discussed the BJP’s landslide victory in three states and the change of generation in the leadership of the BJP in the states. During this discussion, leftist journalist Anil Sinha supported the accused in the recent episode of a security breach in the parliament wherein two youths jumped into the house from the visitor’s gallery and released a yellow gas from the canisters. Anil Sinha said, “We don’t have any IT cell to give reactions on this. Had the names of people from minority communities come up in the recent incident (of parliament security breach), they would have sat with a panel to discuss it by now. They (BJP and its supporters) would have taken a march from Vijay Chowk saying that it is an attack on constitution and democracy. But now they are sitting quietly and presenting it differently. Had Congress defeated them, why would we sit here to discuss and debate? On the Doklam issue, Vishnu Som of NDTV has reported along with satellite pictures. He showed how China has settled colonies there. He expressed doubt that China may manipulate Bhutan against us. But they are saying that Bhutan is with us only. Even the situation in Laddakh and Arunachal Pradesh is the same. There is no debate on China’s infiltration. But you see one on the parliament security breach.”Anil Sinha said, “Parliament me toh apne hi log gaye hain (Those who intruded into the parliament are our men only.) It is just that they entered the parliament in a wrong way. That is their only mistake. But they had gone there to register the protest. They did not harm anybody. Did they? And they raised the same issues (as us). And outside the parliament, they just released the gas. But, how did they reach there in the first place? Even I have covered parliament. How did they enter there crossing layers of security? This just exposes the security system of the new parliament.”That part can be heard after 52 minutes in the above video. Communist Journalists:""Parliament mei toh apne hi log gaye hain""""Kisi ko nuksaan toh pahunchaya nhi""""Protest karne gaye the na bhai"" pic.twitter.com/p4cqSji6udBy calling the parliament intruders ‘Apne Hi Log’, Anil Sinha essentially meant that they belonged to the same ideology as him. He also lauded them for raising the same issues in the parliament which he claimed he was discussing in the debates.On the 22nd anniversary of the 2001 Parliament terror attack, a major security breach occurred when two intruders entered the Lok Sabha chamber from the visitor gallery during Zero Hour. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) ordered an inquiry into a Parliament security breach incident. Six accused have been arrested in this case so far. On Thursday, police sources said that the main conspirator in Wednesday’s Parliament security breach is someone else, as per the initial investigation. The accused had conducted a recce outside the parliament beforehand. Police sources mentioned that all accused were associated with a social media page ‘Bhagat Singh Fan Club.’ Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Copy-paste journalism, reliance on lunatic who wanted Mamata Banerjee raped, claims about ‘SkinDoctor’",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/washington-post-disinfo-lab-article-on-pakistani-conspiracy-theory/,"Despite his questionable character and dwindling credibility, Aveek Sen's misleading tweets on 'Disinfo Lab' became the primary fodder for both 'Pakistani Defence' and 'The Washington Post'.A day after The Washington Post carried out a hit job on Indian OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) handle ‘Disinfo Lab’, it has come to light that some of the outlandish claims made by the American newspaper bear an uncanny resemblance to conspiracy theories peddled by a Pakistani website.In an attempt to de-legitimise ‘Disinfo Lab’, The Washington Post claimed on Sunday (10th December) that the OSINT handle is run by an Indian Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) officer named Lt. Col. Dibya Satpathy.Although it relied on word salad, insinuations, ‘source-based’ allegations and dubious ‘experts’, the American newspaper failed to provide any empirical evidence that could dispute any claims of ‘Disinfo Lab.’Interestingly, a large part of the purported ‘investigation’ by The Washington Post on the Indian OSINT handle appears to be based on conspiracy theories peddled by a website named ‘Pakistan Defence.’In an article titled ‘Disinfo Lab – A Disinformation Project of Indian RA&W’, published by the website in February 2022, a staff writer Amaa’n relied on outlandish claims made by ‘journalist’ Aveek Sen to draw links between ‘Disinfo Lab’ and Indian Intelligence.The ‘Pakistan Defence’ article made references to Lt. Colonel Dibya Satpathy, Ajayendra Tripathi, and BJP leader Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga – all of whom appear prominently in the propaganda piece of The Washington Post.The Pakistani website presented the accusations of Aveek Sen, an abusive troll, as the ‘gospel truth.’ In the tweet from 2013 that went viral, Aveek Sen was seen quoting TimesNow, saying that Mamata Banerjee had called the Barasat rapists ‘CPIM supporters’. To that, Aveek Sen had responded saying “Its high time these cpm supporters rape Mamata!”Prior to deleting his account, Aveek Sen had made several dergatory comments targeting women. A few of his archived misogynist tweets can be seen here – In several of his tweets, Aveek Sen was seen referring to women as ‘prostitutes.’Despite his questionable character and dwindling credibility, Sen’s misleading tweets on ‘Disinfo Lab’ became the primary fodder for both ‘Pakistani Defence’ and ‘The Washington Post’. Interestingly, he had also collaborated with the likes of propaganda outlets such as Newslaundry.“And the making of Indian fake disinfo lab, copying the famous eu disinfo lab that exposed hundreds and thousands of fake Indian websites (By author Aveek sen),” read a line from the article on ‘Pakistan Defence.’Coincidentally, a similar language is used in the report published by The Washington Post. “Another person, a former employee, said the Disinfo Lab named and modelled itself after groups such as the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab and the EU DisinfoLab, a Brussels-based nonprofit that researches disinformation targeting Europe,” it claimed.It claimed, “Some of the fronts, setup by Colonel Dibya Satpathy, per Aveek Sen’s revelation, include: Root N Wings Media, situated at B-3, Bali’s, Near BSES Office, Arya Samaj Mandir, Lajpat Nagar 2, Delhi. Flat A-20, Lajpat Nagar 3, near Ring Road, Delhi.”Interestingly, the claims made it to the report of The Washington Post as well. “The Disinfo Lab, which at one point consisted of about a dozen private contractors working out of a four-story whitewashed building on a leafy street in New Delhi,” the leftist newspaper wrote.In another paragraph, it said, “The office operated under the name Root and Wings Media.” Based on Aveek Sen’s tweets, the shady Pakistani website alleged that Lt. Colonel Dibya Satpathy had been campaigning against the country on the behest of R&AW and BJP.OpIndia found yet another uncanny resemblance in the report of The Washington Post where it said, “The Disinfo Lab itself was headed by Satpathy, whose work has focused mostly on countering Pakistan.”“The Disinfo Lab’s activities show how the online propaganda campaigns waged by the BJP and its allies have been expanding beyond their traditional, domestic aims of shoring up popular support and denigrating opposition parties — and now seek to influence attitudes far beyond India’s borders,” the American newspaper claimed in another part of the article.Both The Washington Post and ‘Pakistan Defence’ made specific references to ‘Root Wings Media’ and characterised it as a ‘social media marketing company/ campaign agency.’“The company has no more than ten employees, typical of an intelligence front,” the Pakistani website said. And this is what the American newspaper claimed – “The Disinfo Lab, which at one point consisted of about a dozen private contractors.” Both The Washingon Post and ‘Pakistan Defence’ targeted targeted the ‘Disinfo Lab’ for exposing the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) and its biased reporting on India, which is often used to cast aspersions on Indian democracy.“Some of the investigative reports published by this website include one aiming to discredit the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom,” wrote ‘Pakistan Defence.’“The Disinfo Lab often cites publicly available U.S. lobbying and campaign finance records and produces complex flowcharts to illustrate alleged relationships. But the group draws tenuous connections, claiming, for instance, that a USCIRF commissioner was influenced by Islamists because she once worked on a conservative fundraising committee alongside a lobbyist who went on to represent Muslim American groups,” claimed The Washington Post.In February this year, OpIndia reported in detail about the ties of former USCIRF Commissioner Anurima Bhargava to far-left billionaire George Soros. We also exposed how the controversial body has relied on the dubious ‘Tek Fog’ story to make insinuations about India.The Washington Post ensured to not include all conspiracy theories to set its ‘investigative article’ apart from that of ‘Pakistan Defence.’ The Pakistani website had even dubbed popular member and dermatologist Neelam Singh aka ‘The Skin Doctor’ as an aide to R&AW officer Lt. Colonel Dibya Satpathy.“The Evil nexus of Col Dibya Satpathy Indian ex-military intelligence officer and bjp troll farms. To (sic) manufacture and spread propaganda and misinformation with the help of Major Neelam “Neel” Kumari alias “The Skin Doctor”, Major Gaurav Arya,” it claimed.‘Pakistan Defence’ accused ‘The Skin Doctor’ of carrying out the ‘evil nexus’ of supposed ‘Disinfo Lab’ founder and Indian Intelligence officerThe Washington Post did not copy-paste the outrageous claims about ‘Disinfo Lab’ only from ‘Pakistan Defence’ but another Pakistani-based website named ‘Centre for Strategic and Contemporary Research (CSCR).Interestingly, CSCR published another misleading piece on ‘Disinfo Lab’ a year before that of ‘Pakistan Defence.’ Habitual fake news peddler and anti-Hindu activist CJ Werleman had made similar insinuations about the Indian OSINT handle in February last year.First, the claim of our association with Govt agencies/ RAW. The report is essentially a recycle of previous reports published by Pakistani ISPR/ Info-war machinery. The report is periodically recycled, last by known fake news peddler CJ Werleman.Lazy Journalism!(2/n) pic.twitter.com/0oXNGfrVyoIn November 2021, CJ Werleman had appealed to boycott Indian products to supposedly ‘save’ Muslims in India and Kashmir. Before that, he had tweeted a video of Pramod Muthalik, the chief of the Hindu activist group Shri Rama Sene, to allege that he called for violence against Muslims and the demolition of a mosque in Karnataka. Earlier, he claimed Indians had destroyed a Muslim graveyard in Himachal Pradesh, which was also fake news. In August 2021 when the Islamist group Taliban took over Afghanistan, Werleman was caught spreading Taliban propaganda. In September 2021, he called for ‘regime decapitation’ strikes against India.The Print, run by Shekhar Gupta had eulogised Werleman in a profile describing him as a ‘bigot-turned-crusader against ‘Islamophobia’ who is taking on the Indian state’. Since every anti-India propagandist is a potential source of The Washington Post, there will surely be no dearth of more anti-India hit pieces ahead of the 2024 elections.While hitting out at The Washington Post, ‘Disinfo Lab’ pointed out that the only difference in its article and past hitjobs against it is the addition of unnamed sources. “The only ‘upgrade’ the WaPo did was to make this Pakistani allegation ‘anonymous’. And whatever is in addition to that is again attributed to ‘anonymous’ sources. Hence, literally, every fact claimed is ‘anonymous’. The report has more than 10 anonymous sources,” it added.As pointed out earlier by OpIndia, The Washington Post failed to refute any assertions made by ‘Disinfo Lab.’ It also noted, “While, in their questions to us and other people, WaPo journalists have themselves noted that our claims are factually correct! (thanks for acknowledgement), they alleged that we make ‘tenuous claims’, and cited a few examples.”While calling out the bluff of the leftist newspaper, Disinfo Lab concluded that The Washington Post is overrated. “It is not surprising that people who don’t understand OSINT are baffled by our reporting. It is especially hard for legacy media journos – Indian and foreign alike, who have known journalism only as handouts from sources. Agencies are overrated. OSINT is underrated,” it emphasised.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

Musk wrote, “I’m literally rofl rn.” Indian American businessman and GOP Presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy faced an embarrassing moment when he forgot to mute his mic while taking a ‘loo break’ from an active X (Twitter) space. Around 2.3 million listeners were tuned in when Ramaswamy encountered the hot mic moment. On the X (Twitter) Space, Ramaswamy was participating in a discussion on the future of technology. During the session, Elon Musk was explaining the rationale behind reinstating the banned X account of Alex Jones, founder of the website Infowars, back on his micro-blogging platform.

But I am not able to mute you.” On returning from the short break, Vivek Ramaswamy realised that his mic was unmuted and understood what had transpired. He immediately apologised for the embarrassing moment. However, on a lighter note, Musk quips, “I hope you feel better now”. To which Ramaswamy replied, “I feel great.

"8 December, 2023 ",High priest to lead the consecration ceremony of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya is a descendant of priest who presided over the coronation of Chhatrapati...,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/know-the-shivaji-connection-of-priest-who-will-lead-ram-temple-consecration/,"More than 40 scholars from Kashi and 121 from all branches of the Vedas throughout India are scheduled to be guided by him during the solemn idol consecration ceremonies from January 16 to January 22. 86-year-old Vedic scholar Laxmikant Mathuranath Dixit is expected to preside over the consecration ritual of the Ram Lalla idol at the Ram temple in Ayodhya on 22 January, marking a landmark confluence of heritage and modern relevance. He is a Varanasi native and reportedly descended from the distinguished Kashi scholar Gaga Bhatt of the 17th century who headed the coronation of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj around 350 years ago in 1674, which was a momentous occasion in Indian history that represented the creation of Hindavi Swarajya, an autonomous Maratha state.More than 40 scholars from Kashi and 121 from all branches of the Vedas throughout India are scheduled to be guided by him during the solemn idol consecration ceremonies from January 16 to January 22. The learned man responded, “It is because of the blessings bestowed on me by the legendary saints and seers of Kashi that I have been assigned the responsibility of supervising the consecration of Ram Lalla. I will perform my duties with the blessings of Lord Ram,” in an interview.The scholar’s son, Sunil Laxmikant Dixit stated that his father’s areas of expertise included yajna, consecration, Srauta which is a Sanskrit word rooted in Sruti or that which is heard and Smarta which is based on Smriti, a particular collection of Hindu literature among other rites and rituals. “My father’s study of the Vedas and rituals was under the supervision of his uncle Ganesh Dixit Javji Bhatt. He completed his studies in Shukla Yajurveda at Sangved Vidyalaya and took up teaching in the same institution. Mathuranath Dixit proclaimed, “Our roots are in Jeur village near Solapur in Maharashtra. Our ancestors moved to Kashi and dedicated their lives to the study of Hindu traditions and rituals.” Laxmikant Mathuranath Dixit and other priests are conducting a series of religious ceremonies as part of the meticulous preparation of the consecration procedures which are scheduled to begin on 16 January. These customs which culminate on 22 January when Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to carry out the rites commemorating the consecration of the Ram Lalla idol include Sarva Prayashchit homam, Dashvid Snan, Jalyatra, Tirth and Kalash Pujan as well as Kalash Yatra.Three idols of Ram Lalla are being made in Ayodhya, and the religious committee of the temple trust is tasked with picking the finest among them. The idols of Lord Ram are believed to be almost finished and are 90% concluded. The idols depict the diety’s child form. One idol is made with stone from Rajasthan and two are made from stones brought from Karnataka, the finishing touches will require around a week. Earlier, a stone was brought from Nepal, and later stones were also brought from Odisha and Maharashtra to carve the idol, but those were found not suitable. The sanctum sanctorum and the temple’s ground floor are already in a highly developed state of preparedness. Among the several ceremonies leading up to the consecration, one of the main ones on 21 January is the immersion of the idol of Ram Lalla in water from sacred rivers and well-known Hindu pilgrimage destinations which is collected in 114 urns. On 22 January in the afternoon, there will be Devpranpratishtha (consecration) rites. The idol will be brought from 8 a.m. to noon to the sanctum sanctorum. Pran-Pratishtha of Ram Lalla will be observed on 16 January and the principal rituals will be performed on 22 January by Lakshmikant Dixit.After visiting the Vice President of Vishva Hindu Parishad Champat Rai in September, the Kanchi Kamakoti Shankaracharya despatched a team of scholars, including Laxmikant Mathuranath Dixit and Acharya Ganesh Shastri Dravid to Ayodhya to determine the dates of consecration.Notable individuals who have been invited to the consecration ceremony of the Ram temple include actors Arun Govil and Dipika Chikhlia who played Lord Ram and Goddess Sita in the hit TV series ‘Ramayana,’ industrialists Mukesh Ambani, Gautam Adani and Ratan Tata, cricketers Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli, Bollywood megastar Amitabh Bachchan among other actors.Over 7,000 guests comprising 3,000 VIPs have received invites from the Ram Mandir Trust. There will also be an invitation sent to the families of the karsevaks who lost their lives in the temple movement. Further invitees consist of 4,000 seers, writers, journalists, scientists, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) president Mohan Bhagwat, yoga guru Ramdev and esteemed figures from all around the nation.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"15 December, 2023 ","Who is Shahrukh Pathan’s father: Convicted for 10 years over drug peddling, evidence of collusion with Pakistanis and more",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/who-is-shahrukh-pathan-father-convicted-10-years-drug-peddling-collusion-pakistani-delhi-riots/,"The bail order made several revelations about Shahrukh Patha, the case and the remorseless conduct of Pathan after he was arrested, based on the evidence provided by the prosecution which were accepted by the court. Shahrukh Pathan, who pointed a gun at a policeman during the anti-Hindu riots in North-East Delhi in 2020, was refused regular bail by a Delhi court on 14th December. The court stated it observed no need to grant him bail and Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat of Karkardooma Court noted, “Considering the conduct of the accused Shahrukh Pathan in jail during his judicial custody, his conduct prior to his being arrested, conduct during court proceedings and most importantly, the allegations against the accused which are being supported by the eyewitnesses and also the video footage, on any of the counts on which bail can be considered, the court sees nothing to set him enlarged on bail.”The bail order made several revelations about Shahrukh Patha,n the case and the remorseless conduct of Pathan after he was arrested, based on the evidence provided by the prosecution which was accepted by the court. The case pertains to the infamous picture where Shahrukh Pathan was seen holding a gun to a police officer’s head during the Delhi anti-hindu riots. During the riot, on the 24th of February 2020, a confrontation broke out between Jaffrabad Metro Station and Maujpur Bridge. There were more than 5,000 people who came face to face in that area. The anti-CAA protestors (Islamist mob) were pelting stones and brandishing guns. When the investigation was carried out, 3 cartridges were found at the spot where Shahrukh Pathan brandished a gun, aimed at the head of a police officer in uniform. The order details how Shahrukh Pathan first fired a few rounds at the crowd and refused to pay heed to the warnings issued by the police officer. When he advanced, for the safety of the crowd, the police officer stood in his path and did not move. When Pathan was at a distance of 9-10 feet from the police officer, he fired his weapon aimed at the police officer’s head to kill him. The police officer dodged the bullet but continued to stand there in his path so he couldn’t advance further and kill the Hindus. As the police officer refused to move, Pathan pushed the officer and then aimed the gun at his head again. When the police officer issued another warning after being pushed, Shahrukh Pathan fired at the crowd and started retreating. It was only after sustained interrogation that Shahrukh Pathan revealed his full identity and confessed to his involvement in the crime. The prosecution has also argued that Shahrukh Pathan was not only attempting to kill the police officer but was also leading the mob. Interestingly, the order reveals how Shahrukh Pathan was not cooperative during the investigation and refused to reveal the identity of other rioters who were involved. During the investigation, it is detailed, that Pathan also tried his best to mislead the police. He has also displayed aggressive and remorseless conduct in jail. The prosecution argued that if let out on bail, he could potentially influence witnesses and tamper with evidence. Also, given the fear of the 10-year jail term that could be handed to him, he could abscond. Taking into account his conduct inside the jail and during the investigation, the court agreed with the prosecution and refused to grant him bail. In the order document detailing the arguments of the prosecution, there was one specific argument that deserved further investigation. The prosecution had argued that Shahrukh Pathan’s father, Sabir Ali (alias Baldev Singh) was convicted for 10 years with a fine of Rs 1 lac under Section 14 of the Foreigners Act and sections of the NDPS Act. OpIndia pulled up the court judgement in the case where Shahrukh Pathan’s father was convicted by a Delhi court. The judgement convicting him was pronounced on 11th August 2016. The facts of the case, detailed in the court order, almost read like a movie. In January 2010, Meghalaya Police filed a complaint in Delhi that three Pakistani nationals Abdul Razzaq, Mohd. Saddique and Rafakat Ali who had been brought from Lampur Seva Sadan (FRRO detention centre) on 1st January 2010 to Guru Nanak Eye Hospital for their medical examination had escaped while they were being taken back. During the investigation to track down the missing Pakistanis, the visitor’s register which was maintained by Meghalaya Police was also checked. The entries in the register made from 28/9/2009 to 02/01/2010 revealed that two people – Anees Khan and Arbaz Khan – had met Abdul Razzaq and Saleem on 29/12/2009 and 30/12/2009. During interrogation, it was revealed that before absconding on 1/1/2010, the three Pakistanis had after going to Gurunanak Eye Hospital were first taken to Jama Masjid and then one of them (Abdul Razzak) was taken by him to Seelampur near Jaffarbad to collect money from someone. Anees and Arbaz were nephews of Sabir Ali. It is pertinent to understand here that the three Pakistanis were in India illegally and therefore, were being held at a detention centre. From the story so far, it is also clear that they were given harbour at Jama Masjid from where one of them was taken to Seelampur (near Jaffrabad) to collect money – the very area where the Delhi anti-Hindu riots had broken out in February 2020 – in which Shahrukh Pathan was also leading a mob. Based on this investigation, Sabir Ali (Baldev Singh), Anees Khan and Arbaz were called to the Special Cell office and inquiries were made from them. During interrogation, it was revealed that it was Sabir Ali (Baldev Singh) who had given money to Abdul Razzaq at Seelampur before he had absconded. Essentially, from the records so far, it is clear that it was Shahrukh Pathan’s father who had give money to a Pakistani before they had absconded. This money was give to the illegal in Seelampur. The numbers that were taken from the accused during interrogation were then thoroughly investigated after those detained and questioned – including the father of Shahrukh Pathan – were set free. During the surveillance of the numbers, it was revealed that the accused – including Pathan’s father – were involved in the business of fake currency and drugs. There was also an intercepted call where Sabir Ali had spoken about the international smuggling of drugs. After this surveillance, when a notice was served to Sabir Ali, Arbaz and Anees, they refused to answer the notice served by the special cell. The Special Cell then received information about a Charas and Smack delivery that Sabir Ali and his co-accused Sannaullah Mir were about to make. When the raiding party intercepted Ali and Mir, they discovered drugs in their possession. Substantial amounts of drugs were also found on the scooter of Sabir Ali – the substance in the scooter was heroin. After the subsequent arrest, Mir and Ali were interrogated separately. During interrogation, the father of Shahrukh Pathan, Sabir Ali, confessed that he was in the business of drugs and fake currency notes along with his associates Anees, Arbaz, Jarnail and Mir. He also disclosed how the police could arrest Jarnail Singh and revealed that on an earlier occasion, Singh had given him 2 lacs and drugs, parts of which were then distributed to the others. He also agreed to lead the police to another accused – Javed. Several of the co-accused were then arrested post-interrogation of Ali. In 2011, all the accused persons were charged for the offences u/s 29 r.w.s. 21, 20 and 23 of the NDPS Act and accused Sabir Ali was separately charged for the offence u/s 21(c), 25A of the NDPS Act and accused Sanaullah Mir was separately charged for the offence of u/s 20 (b) (ii) (C) of the NDPS Act. All the accused persons were also charged for the offences u/s 489 C r.w.s. 120B IPC.In court, the prosecution examined 39 witnesses in all to prove its case against the accused. All the accused, including the father of Shahrukh Pathan, took the defence that they had been falsely implicated by the police and that no contraband/counterfeit currency notes had been recovered from their possession or at their instance at any point in time. Among all the accused, the court ‘particularly’ was intrigued by the defence of Sabir Ali alias Baldev Singh. It is pertinent to mention here that Shahrukh Pathan’s father was previously a Sikh named Baldev Singh and had converted to Islam before marrying. When Sabir Ali started explaining why he was supposedly implicated by the police, he ended up revealing his long illustrious career as a criminal. Here is what the court document said: “In particular accused Baldev Singh has stated that he originally belongs to Punjab and shifted to Delhi in 1984 due to political turmoil and terrorist activities in Punjab. In Delhi he started selling garments from a patri in Chandni Chowk but in the year 1984 the police officials of Maurice Nagar falsely arrested him on a mere suspicion that he was a terrorist. When their enquiry into his antecedents did not reveal anything incriminating against him, they planted contraband on him and falsely implicated him in a case under the Excise Act. After spending three years in the jail in the said case, he came out and started working as a driver for a transport company. During the said services a vehicle which he was driving was intercepted by DRI and contraband was recovered from the same. Though he had no knowledge and had nothing to do with the contraband concealed in the said vehicle, he was arrested by DRI and also subsequently convicted in the said case and again spent more than 10 years in judicial custody. After coming out from the jail after undergoing the sentence in the said case he again started his life afresh and started doing the business of pannis/plastics and started living with his children, his wife, his brother in law, Anees and Arbaz, the son of his second brother in law Babu Khan, in his house H.No. U­108, Gali no. 5, Arvind Nagar, Gautam Vihar, Gonda. He suspects that somebody in his locality informed the local police officials about his previous records and that is why the officials of Special Cell came to his residence in the first week of January, 2010 and forcibly picked him, his son and Anees and Arbaz and took them to PS and started inquiring about same Pakistani nationals who had absconded. Though they were released from the PS after the police officials found nothing incriminating against them, on 3/9/2010 again he, Anees and Arbaz were forcibly picked up from their residence at 1:30 a.m. in the night and brought to the office of Special cell, Rohini and falsely implicated in this case”. Essentially, Shahrukh Pathan’s father at the time had asserted that he was being falsely implicated by the police in this case of collusion with Pakistanis and being involved in an international drug peddling and fake currency racket because he had done exactly that in the past, been convicted for it, and therefore, the police thought of him as a convenient target. Further, he also dared to claim that all the previous times he was caught with contrabands and convicted, even then, he was falsely implicated. The shoddy defence that was put up by Sabir Ali was backed only by one witness – the witness’ only testimony was that he had never seen a Pakistani enter the home of Ali. This statement was made without any evidence. The court said, “The testimony of the prosecution witnesses is trustworthy and believable and nothing has emerged in their cross­examination which cast doubt on the veracity of their statement or to impeach their creditworthiness”. The court also said that all the seizure of drugs and fake currency was done per the law. While the defence tried to puncture technical holes in the process, the court threw out all of their arguments and convicted the accused – including Sabir Ali. To that effect, the court said, “as far as recovery of contraband from accused Baldev Singh and Sanaullah is concerned, in my view, the prosecution has been able to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt”. While the court rejected the argument that the accused were colluding with each other, it convicted all accused for the possession of contraband substances, however, there was amply evidence of collusion as well based on the statements of Ali. Based on this evidence, Sabir Ali, the father of Shahrukh Pathan, was sentenced to 10 years in prison and 1 lac fine in 2016. According to reports, Shahrukh’s mother also is said to be a notorious drug peddler.In his show ‘Prime Time’ on 26th February 2020, Ravish Kumar resorted to spreading half-truths and full lies about the horrifying spate of violence that had engulfed the national capital. In pursuance of what appeared as his agenda to tarnish Hindus and portray them as the aggressors of the riots, Kumar identified Mohammad Shahrukh alias Shahrukh Pathan, who fired at Delhi Police personnel on February 24, as one ‘Anurag Mishra’. For the 26th February show, Ravish claimed that police had not yet arrested him while he was arrested on 25th February itself, good 24 hours before his show premiered. “Police ki haalat yeh hai ki abhi tak giraftar nahin hua hai. Police saaf kehti hai ki Shahrukh hai magar aap social media mein dekhiye Anurag Mishra bataya jaa raha hai. (Situation of the Police is such that they have not yet arrested him. Police says his name is Shahrukh but if you see on social media, he is called Anurag Mishra),” he spoke in his characteristic drawl during the show. Naturally, it was quite a revelation since no one had yet referred to the shooter as “Anurag Mishra” till then.He then asked Delhi Police to speak out on his identity again. He then played an undated speech of his reporter who appeared to be asking Delhi Police personnel about Shahrukh’s arrest. Slyly, Ravish Kumar then played the videos of BJP leaders Anurag Thakur, Kapil Mishra and Pravesh Verma addressing rallies ahead of Delhi elections to cast aspersions that their speeches were responsible for stoking riots a month later. Further, in August 2021, 18 months after the 25-year-old Delhi anti-Hindu riots accused Shahrukh Pathan was arrested for brandishing a gun at the police and threatening them, The Quint published a white paper on him watering down his crime and making him appear like a cherubic saint. The Quint started by describing his menacing march as ‘brazen confidence in his gait’. Then the writer of the ‘Shahrukh Pathan fan page’ romanticised his criminal act. “Unfazed by the policemen in riot gear, he shot bullets in the air while media persons captured his acts in astonishment. The fact that the gym enthusiast, who was also a local, did not wear a mask to hide his identity, made his ‘bravado’ seem peculiar and odd,” the author wrote. The Quint then went on to explain how his friends described Shahrukh as someone who was into grooming and was interested in his appearance. He was characterised as someone who was a biryani-lover, liked to put gel in his hair, blow dry it, wear crisp, ironed shirts, good shoes and well, make TikTok videos. The author interviewed Pathan’s mother, who had glowing views about her son. She said her son was innocent and ‘simple-minded’.Shahrukh’s mother also highlighted counterfactual scenarios to water down her son’s criminality. She told his fans at The Quint that she often wonders, “What if she had given him food when he asked? What if the timing was a few minutes before or after namaz?” Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

"15 December, 2023 ","‘They came in a vehicle with no number plates, set fire on Bittu Bajrangi’s brother’: Arman had earlier burned his own shop to blame...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/bittu-bajrangis-brother-set-on-fire-arman-had-earlier-burned-his-own-shop-to-blame-hindus-says-activist/,"Bittu Bajrangi said that during the Nuh riots, Armaan used to sell juice in Faridabad. He had set his own shop on fire and had tried to blame local Hindus for it. However, his lie was caught during the police investigation.On Wednesday (December 13th) Hindu activist Bittu Bajrangi’s family was targeted and attackers attempted to burn his brother Mahesh Panchal alive by pouring thinner on him in the Dabua Colony in Haryana’s Faridabad. Within hours, victim Mahesh Panchal was transferred from three hospitals while in a critical condition. Mahesh has sustained severe burn injuries, estimated to be around 60%, and he is in critical condition. The next 72 hours, according to the doctors, will be crucial for the victim.As per the information received, the assailants who burned Mahesh first attempted to capture and burn him, but they were unsuccessful. Subsequently, they poured thinner on Mahesh and set him ablaze. Following this, the accused escaped. Mahesh dived into a drain right away, but the fire was not extinguished. He then took 3-4 dips, and the fire was quenched. After that, he walked to his house, which was around 800 metres away on his own as nobody came forward to help him. When finally Mahesh somehow reached his home, Bittu Bajrangi took him the the hospital. According to media reports, the attackers led by one Armaan first confirmed Bittu Bajrangi’s brother Mahesh Panchal’s identity. ‘Are you the brother of Bittu Bajrangi?’ they questioned Mahesh Panchal. When Mahesh said yes to this question, they poured thinner on him and set him ablaze.Arman Khan, the main accused in this case, has been arrested by police and is being interrogated. Meanwhile, the police have examined the crime scene. According to the report, the white WagonR used by the attackers had no registration number. Moreover, two bikes had followed him suspiciously to the location.Meanwhile, Bittu Bajrangi stated that Mahesh has been moved around three hospitals so far. First, it was the government hospital, then it was Santosh Hospital, and now it is Prachi Hospital. The doctors have said that the next 72 hours will be critical. Several members of Hindu organisations and local BJP MLAs visited the hospital to inquire about Mahesh’s well-being.Bittu Bajrangi said that during the Nuh riots, Armaan used to sell juice in Faridabad. He had set his own shop on fire and had tried to blame local Hindus for it. However, his lie was caught during the police investigation.Bittu Bajrangi further stated that he had been receiving death threats for a long with those behind the threats asking him to “take his slippers back (Chappal lekar jao)”. The code ‘chappal’ was used by the perpetrators to remind Bajrangi about the slippers Hindus had left outside the temple when the Islamist mob attacked them during Nuh violence earlier this year.Bittu alleged that the attackers who attempted to kill his brother were all involved in the July 31 violence unleashed by Islamists in Haryana’s Nuh district. Bittu Bajrangi stated that the family sought an arms licence, but the administration refused. Not only that, but Bittu said, citing a police officer, that the person who issued the threats had also threatened a prominent Gurgaon businessman for ‘protection money’ adding that he is a seasoned criminal.Meanwhile, an OpIndia team arrived on the scene and found several police personnel stationed at the hospital. Several members of Hindu organisations also convened at the hospital. However, no one is permitted to meet with the victim. The police have imposed multiple sections in this case, including sections 147, 149, 307, and 326A. Arman, the accused, is being questioned by local police.Bittu Bajrangi told OpIndia that he is satisfied with the actions taken by the Faridabad Police in the matter so far. He has also urged people to refrain from engaging in any form of protest or unlawful activity.Bittu Bajrangi is a Hindu activist who raises his voice for the unity of Hindus. After the violence that erupted in Nuh in the Mewat region, his name gained more traction in the news. Subsequently, he was also arrested in a case of a clash with the police. At present, Bittu Bajrangi is out of jail on bail. In this case, all Hindu organisations supported him. Initially, the rumour spread rapidly that Bittu Bajrangi was associated with the Nuh violence, but the police made it clear that action was taken against Bittu Bajrangi not related to the Nuh violence, but in a different case of a clash with the police.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"15 December, 2023 ","Pune: Govt land in Kondhwa’s Hindu locality allotted for playground being converted into Muslim ‘Qabristan’, residents complain. Here’s all you need to know",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/pune-govt-land-kondhwa-hindu-locality-playground-converted-into-muslim-qabristan/,"The letter submitted by the societies around survey no 44 amenity space states that there are around 12000-15000 Hindu families residing in the locality and hardly any Muslim people stay in the societies. ""There are also several temples in the area and converting the space into a Muslim burial ground might harm our religious sentiments,"" the letter reads. In a shocking case that has come to the fore from the Kondhwa region of Maharashtra’s Pune district, government land that had been earlier allotted for the construction of a playground is now being converted into a Muslim burial ground. This is after the former NCP MLA Chetan Tupe and BJP’s Yogesh Tilekar submitted a letter to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) suggesting that the amenity space around some of the Hindu societies in Kondhwa could be the perfect location to build a burial ground (Qabristan) for the Muslim community.BJP’s Yogesh Tilekar later backtracked from the suggestion, reportedly after realising the problems of the locals and after he was informed about the issues in the area.  The letter claimed that the Kondhwa region in Pune has a large Muslim population and that it would be favorable for the community to have a burial ground nearby. Former Hadapsar @NCPspeaks MLA Chetan Tupe @ChetanVTupe n @BJP4Maharashtra leader Yogesh Tilekar @iYogeshTilekar recommended converting a Hindu-majority residential area's of #Kondhwa playground into a Muslim burial ground. Pune Municipal Corporation @PMCPune has spent 46 lakh… pic.twitter.com/AKS6vc0FfaSeveral Hindu societies around the said amenity space (survey no. 44) have complained to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) objecting to the construction of a burial ground for the Muslim community. “The societies around the plot are Hindu societies and several thousand Hindu families reside in this location. Several Hindu temples are also located in the area and building a burial ground for the Muslim community here might cause religious harm to the residents,” the letter by Raviraj Colorado Co-op Housing Society read. The complaint dated 23rd October has been exclusively obtained by OpIndia upon which no action has been taken by the PMC yet. Similar complaint letters have been submitted by Achalnagar Sahakari Gruharachana Society Ltd and Shree Vardhaman Nagar Co-op Housing Society Ltd to the PMC highlighting that around 12000 to 15000 Hindu families reside in the locality and that it would be wrong to allow amenity space that was supposed to be a playground for a Muslim burial ground. The complaint letters obtained by OpIndia have been signed by all the society members who are Hindus. Amenity space is a portion of a building that adds convenience for all occupants of a building and that is not used exclusively by any one occupant. In the current case, the amenity space is just a wall close to societies that have registered complaints and the space is authoritatively looked after by the PMC. The controversy has been long-standing since the year 2021 when NCP MLA Chetan Tupe Patil submitted a letter to the PMC suggesting that the amenity space on survey no. 44 plot should be made a Muslim burial ground given that the Kondhwa region in Pune houses a large Muslim population. However, in between these years, it was later advised by the PMC’s Amenity Space Committee that a Muslim burial ground would be constructed in the amenity space on surveys no. 18 and 19 and that a playground would be constructed on survey no. 44 space. The Muslim community members then happened to press that a burial ground on survey no. 44 space would be better given the closer distance and that the supposed burial ground in Survey no 18 and 19 space would cause commuting problems for the community. Several letters to PMC pressing their demand for survey no 44 space were sent by the Nagarsevak, Adv Abdul Gafar Pathan, Parveen Haji Firoz Sheikh, and former NCP MLA Chetan Tupe Patil. The letters erroneously claimed that most of the population residing around the survey no. 44 plots were Muslims and it would be a feasible space for Muslim burial ground. A similar letter advocating for a Qabristan on survey no. 44 land was submitted by the BJP’s Yogesh Tilekar on 8th May 2023 to the PMC. The letter stated that survey no. 18 and 19 spaces were too far from the Muslim locality residing in Kondhwa and that making a burial ground on survey no. 44 space would be feasible instead. The PMC on 16th May then approved the proposal based on the letter submitted by Tilekar. However, it has come to the fore that Tilekar submitted the letter after the local Muslim community members sought his help regarding the land issue. The Muslim community representatives informed Tilekar that a maximum of the Muslim population resides around survey no. 44 amenity space and that it should be converted into a Muslim burial ground. OpIndia talked to BJP MLA Yogesh Tilekar confirming the incident. He exclusively informed OpIndia that he was misinformed about the survey no. 44 spaces and the ongoing project of playground construction on the land. “I didn’t know the land was already allotted by the PMC for a playground construction. Neither did the local Muslim representatives tell me nor the PMC. The letter I sent in May 2023 pressed for a burial ground on survey no. 44 space. However, after I learned that the maximum of population residing around the survey no. 44 space is Hindu, I sent another letter demanding the cancellation of the allotment of the land for a Muslim burial ground,” Tilekar said while talking to OpIndia. The letter of cancellation that Tilekar sent to the PMC on 23rd October 2023 clearly states that the survey no. 44 amenity space is located in a crowded area and most of the population that resides in the societies around the space is Hindu. “I first thought that the area housed a large Muslim population but I was misinformed. Most of the population residing in the locality is Hindu,” the letter reads. The entire incident was exposed after an RTI activist Dr Paritosh Zaware Patil residing in the Raviraj Colorado Co-op Housing Society (next to survey no 44 amenity space) filed an RTI demanding details of the location. It came to the fore that the PMC had already allotted the land for the construction of a playground and that the government had already spent Rs 43 lakhs for construction. Surprisingly, the land still is vacant and is under controversy over the Muslim burial ground construction. The land was allotted for the construction of the playground in the year 2017 and in 2019 grant of Rs 43 lakhs for the purpose was also obtained. The project of construction of the playground was given to some Salim Construction in the year 2019 and Rs 49 lakhs had been spent for the purpose. “The land is still vacant and no playground has been constructed here. Instead, they want to make a Muslim burial ground here. This is a crowded locality and we don’t want our children to see anything that would not be good for their age,” Dr Patil confirmed. Dr. Paristosh Patil while talking to OpIndia confirmed that survey no 18 and 19 are in the East part of the Kondhwa region and that it still stands vacant. “Some people had demanded that a vegetable market should be developed there. However, in the Amenity space committee meeting, the PMC denied the permission. That land can easily be converted into a Muslim burial ground. No problem at all. But the Muslim community members want survey no 44 amenity space only which is located in the crowded Hindu locality. They say that it is a closer option for them.” Patil added that he or the other society members have nothing to do with the community. “We are not against the Muslim community. Our problem is the burial ground. How can it be constructed in a densely crowded residential locality? All our society’s flat doors face the ground and families stay with us. What if our children ask tomorrow about the burials? Like what it is and why does this happen? Many children residing in the society are too young to see this. Even if there was a demand for Hindu cremation ground, we would have opposed it,” he added. The letter submitted by the societies around survey no 44 amenity space states that there are around 12000-15000 Hindu families residing in the locality and hardly any Muslim people stay in the societies. “There are also several temples in the area and converting the space into a Muslim burial ground might harm our religious sentiments,” the letter reads. The complaint also says that constructing a Muslim burial ground might create health hazards. “Water used for the process might seep into the society pipes causing health hazards. The societies and the survey no 44 amenity space are just a wall away from each other,” Dr Patil confirmed. Team OpIndia also talked to some of the other society residents to know about the Muslim burial ground being constructed on the nearby premises. One of the Raviraj Colorado society residents stated that several unknown persons are calling the society residents after the complaint to the PMC saying the Muslim burial ground will be built on survey no. 44 land come what may. “People are threatening us and saying that the inauguration of the burial ground will be executed in January next year. We all are scared and don’t want to see people getting buried there,” said Neelam Shah, one of the residents (name changed for security reasons). She further added that several Hindu organizations and concerned legal committees are looking into the case and people here are even ready to protest. “The roadway to the ground is really narrow as the locality is already crowded. Single lanes lead to the ground in question. School buses also pass through the same routes. Imagine now if someone dies from their community (God forbid) and they get the body to the ground for burial and then there’s also a bus passing through the same route.. our children will be forced to see what they should not at this age? Moreover, the traffic issues might also increase. The Muslim burial ground here is a bad idea,” she pressed. Neelam further added that the amenity space which is vacant at present is used by some of the miscreants to carry out immoral and illegal activities. On asking about the ‘immoral activities’, Shah said that people use the site for drinking and all wrong purposes after the evening hours. “This also should stop,” she demanded.The resident also added that some of the people living in the societies are leaving their properties and selling at a loss due to the increasing influence of the Muslim community. “The Muslim burial ground is making people leave their hard-earned homes. This is not done,” she adds. Another resident Jyotsna Patil (name changed for security reasons) also confirmed that most of the population staying here in the Kondhwa region is Hindu. “The burial ground can result in severe health hazards. Not instantly but in the coming 4-5 years people will notice changes in the environment here and their health to be specific. This is hazardous. Also, this is a Hindu community crowded space. Religiously, it would be incorrect to have another community burial ground here. Strict action should be taken in this case,” Patil said. The PMC is said to have taken action based on the letter submitted by BJP’s Yogesh Tilekar. However, Tilekar stated that he was misinformed about the location and that no he is ready to do anything to stop the ‘playground’ being converted into a Muslim burial ground. Reportedly, the Amenity Space Committee of Pune Municipal Corporation has taken no action on the cancellation request submitted by the BJP MLA. The decision shall be taken in the upcoming meeting of the body. At present, the amenity space contains a jogging track and a few rest places. The remaining portion of the land stands vacant. It is important to note that Pune’s Kondhwa region has been in the news for some time. In July this year, the National Investigation Agency arrested a doctor from the Kondhwa region for sheltering ISIS members. Also, three residents from the Mithanagar area of Kondhwa had been arrested by NIA for promoting terrorist activities at the behest of the global terrorist outfit Islamic State (IS). Later, in August, it had come to the fore that the accused ISIS operatives organized and participated in bomb-making workshops in Pune’s Kondhwa area in 2022. The central investigation agency received credible intelligence that these accused and their associates were recruiting youth and training them to make Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) and weapons. They also shared Do It Yourself (DIY) kits and other relevant materials among themselves for creating IEDs and manufacturing small weapons, pistols, and more. Notably, the accused were also involved in creating content for the pro-ISIS magazine ‘Voice of Hind’. The online magazine led to several raids by the NIA in October 2021 in Kashmir. On 5th August, the accused were sent to ATS custody by a Pune court. ATS informed the court they found incriminating material from the accused, including an Indian map with several cities marked, laptops containing material to study the modus operandi of terror attacks, and more. The initial probe revealed they have links to the Al Sufa module. However, a later investigation revealed they all were part of ISIS.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"14 December, 2023 ",Parliament security breach: How the intruders smuggled smoke canisters inside the high-security premises,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/parliament-security-breach-how-the-intruders-smuggled-smoke-canisters/,"Hundreds of visitors are arriving at the parliament daily, especially after the inauguration of the new parliament, however, the staff is limited. In a major security breach since the 2001 Parliament attack, two persons jumped into the Lok Sabha well on December 13 from the visitors’ gallery while the proceedings were going on and released yellow-coloured smoke from canisters. The question here arises that despite multiple security checks and frisking, how did the intruders manage to smuggle the smoke canisters inside the Parliament. Apparently, the intruders carried the smoke canisters in the shoes they were wearing.Notably, the Parliament Security Service operates under the administrative control of the Joint Secretary (Security) of the Lok Sabha Secretariat and oversees the security operations of both Secretariats. After the deadly attacks on the Parliament in 2001, several measures were taken to streamline the access points, advanced security gadgets were deployed, and a high-tech access control system was implemented to ensure the safety and security of the MPs and VVIPs. In addition, Radio Frequency Tags were introduced to enhance the identification processes.The intruders Sagar Sharma and Manoranjan managed to breach the three-tier security of the parliament. The initial check is undertaken at the Parliament premises’ entry gate. Subsequently, another check is conducted involving metal detectors and hand-held metal detector frisking. This is followed by another round of checking at the Parliament building’s entrance gate, with additional security deployed in the corridor leading to the visitors’ galleries. While the visitors were not allowed to carry cell phones inside the gallery, the intruders were skillfully carrying smoke canisters made of plastic in their shoes.An obvious question that comes to the mind here is why was the smoke cannister not detected during any of the three tiers of security checks including metal detector frisking. To understand this, one must recall the “Shoe Bomber” Richard Reid’s failed attempt to detonate a bomb on American Airlines Flight 63 from Paris to Miami 22 years back on December 22, 2001. Richard Reid had converted to Islam and joined the Islamic terrorist group Al-Qaeda. Interestingly, Reid was carrying the bomb with around 10 ounces of explosives in his shoes when he boarded the flight. Despite the prior security checks, the bomb Reid was carrying could not be detected.Fortunately, the terrorist failed in his attempt to blow up the plane mid-air as a co-passenger smelled the sulphur and Reid was then pinned down, sedated and eventually handed over to the security officials. This incident, however, demonstrated that, unless shoes are removed and checked separately, they can pass through security with plastic explosives stuffed within. For this, in the US and Europe, passengers at the airport are required to take off their shoes, belts, all metallic objects, cellphones and other electronic items in a separate tray before passing through the metal detectors.During the security checks at the parliament, the officials usually do not check the shoes of the visitors. As reported earlier, two of the accused had conducted recce outside the parliament beforehand, during the Budget session as well as the monsoon session. Had the frisking staff regularly checked the insides or the soles of the shoes of the visitors including those of the two intruders on Wednesday, the duo could have been caught beforehand. The incident has aptly triggered a serious review of the security arrangements as there could been noxious contents in the canisters smuggled in by the now-arrested intruders. Citing a Parliament Security Services official, Indian Express reported that hundreds of visitors are arriving at the parliament daily, especially after the inauguration of the new parliament, however, the staff is limited. The report adds citing sources that “301 security officers are usually deployed inside Parliament, but on Wednesday, 176 were present.”Notably, the security breach took place at 1 PM on December during the zero hour in the Lok Sabha, just before the lunch break. When Khagen Murmu, BJP MP from West Bengal, was raising some points regarding his constituency, a commotion was suddenly heard in the background. When the Sansad TV switched to the view of the entire hall, a man could be seen who had already jumped from the gallery and was on the benches. He then started to proceed towards the front of the hall, jumping from bench to bench.  #WATCH | An unidentified man jumps from the visitor's gallery of Lok Sabha after which there was a slight commotion and the House was adjourned. pic.twitter.com/Fas1LQyaO4A video from the Lok Sabha shows the members of Parliament assaulting one of the two perpetrators who burst into the chamber during proceedings and tossed canisters emitting yellow smoke. The MPs can be seen plucking the hairs of the intruder, hurling shoes at him, and landing punches at him before encircling him. Meanwhile, the Lok Sabha secretariat has reportedly suspended eight security officials in connection with the security breach. As the Winter Session of Parliament resumed this morning, security measures were significantly increased.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

The High Court asked for a policy within a week. CM Bhagwant Mann is the jail minister. What did he do?… Drug tablets are being sold inside the jails… If I am proven a liar, I will leave politics,” Sidhu said, speaking to reporters on Saturday.The Punjab and Haryana High Court has recently sought a status report from the Punjab and Haryana governments on the steps taken after the BSF gave a list of 75 individuals suspected of involvement in drug trafficking to the Punjab Police.The High Court took cognizance of a news article published in an English newspaper that mentioned that the Border Security Force (BSF) gave a list of 75 individuals suspected of involvement in drug trafficking to the Punjab Police.Moreover, the High Court has made the Punjab and Haryana governments and the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) parties in this case and has issued a notice and ordered them to file their replies.According to the data released by BSF, BSF has seized around 755 kg of narcotics so far in the year 2023. 95 drones coming from Pakistan have been shot down. 36 Pakistani nationals have been arrested, of whom 15 rifles and 38 pistols have been recovered. In addition to this, nine Pakistanis who were trying to cross the border have been killed.“The State of Punjab is directed to file a status report with respect to the steps being taken in pursuance of the report given to it by the BSF. The State of Haryana will also file a status report regarding the steps being taken in the state in the matter,” the court order read.“NCB is also directed to file a status report giving details of the persons suffering from drug addiction in the States of Punjab and Haryana and what kind of steps can be taken, to make persons who till date are not in drug addiction, aware of the drug menace, and how they should be prevented from taking drugs, as the narcotic items recovered in the State of Punjab, as reported in the news paper, are huge,” it added.Earlier on Monday, the Border Security Force (BSF) Special DG of Western Command said that it has given a list of suspected drug traders in the border areas of Punjab to the Punjab Police. The BSF has also recommended their detention under the Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1988.(With inputs from ANI)Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"16 December, 2023 ",‘Dharavi tender was finalised transparently when MVA govt was in power’: Adani group responds to Uddhav Thackeray’s allegations against the redevelopment project,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/adani-group-responds-to-uddhav-thackerays-allegations-against-the-dharavi-project/,"""It is unfortunate that a concerted effort is being made to disseminate misinformation about certain aspects of the project,"" a press release issued by Adani Group said after Uddhav Thackeray launched a protest against the projectOn 16th December (Saturday), Adani Group released a press statement asserting that the project for the redevelopment of the Dharavi slum in Mumbai was awarded to the Adani Group through a fair, open, and internationally competitive bidding process. The group highlighted that the tender conditions were finalised when the MVA government was in power.The official response from the company came in the backdrop that Shiv Sena (UBT) leader and former Maharashtra CM  Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday led a protest march of the party, alleging favour to Adani Group in connection with the Dharavi redevelopment project.Adani Group says, ""The Dharavi project was awarded to the Adani Group through a fair, open, internationally competitive bidding process.

Hence, it is wrong to claim that any special benefits have been given to the awardee.” #WATCH | Mumbai, Maharashtra | Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray led a protest march of the party, alleging favour to Adani Group in connection with the Dharavi redevelopment project.Visuals of the protest from earlier today, at T Junction of Dharavi area. pic.twitter.com/zFlevoCjX7The group reiterated that all eligible tenement holders will be moved into their new homes in Dharavi itself. As per the tender conditions, even ineligible tenement holders will be provided accommodation under the Rental Housing Policy. The tender provisions also ensure that eligible residential tenements will receive 17% more area than other SRA projects in Mumbai, the statement added.Meanwhile, addressing the protesters, Uddhav Thackeray alleged that the redevelopment project involves TDR irregularities worth more than Rs 100 crore, which is the “biggest scam in the world”. Leading the march from Dharavi to Adani office in Bandra, the former CM demanded that the government should redevelop the slum, not the Adani Group, and Dharavi residents should get the houses they deserve. Regarding the TDR allegations, the Adani group stressed that the resettlement of Dharavikars is not affected by Transferable Development Rights (TDR). Also, the TDR from the project will be managed and monitored transparently through a specially created portal by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) and the Government of Maharashtra, the group added in its press release.CM Eknath Shinde also countered Uddhav Thackeray for his opposition to the project, saying that when Uddhav Thackeray became the CM under the MVA alliance, he had stalled many projects started by the earlier BJP-Shiv Sena government, which had impeded the development of the state. Notably, in July, the Maharashtra government officially awarded the Dharavi Redevelopment project, spanning 259 hectares, to an Adani group firm.The Maharashtra government has entered into a 99-year lease agreement with the Indian Railways and then it will be sub-leased on 30 years+30 years basis like any other government land in Mumbai to the housing societies. There is no change in this policy for the Dharavi Redevelopment Project, the release added.The official release has been issued through the Spokesperson of Dharavi Redevelopment Project Private Ltd (DRPPL). In the statement, the Spokesperson added, “There is a general consensus, not only in Mumbai and Maharashtra but also across the whole of India, for transforming Dharavi and providing the people of Dharavi with better living conditions, adequate hygiene, education, and vocational training, healthcare, employment opportunities, essential amenities and a life of dignity.”The DRPPL stressed that the Dharavi project assumes added significance because many earlier attempts have failed to deliver. “There is no gainsaying the fact that a transformational project like Dharavi needs support from all stakeholders, including from political parties cutting across ideologies and differences. This is a historic opportunity to build a new, state-of-the-art Dharavi which reflects the hopes and aspirations of Dharavikars,” the press release further added. It is important to note that in August 2023, the Maharashtra government filed an affidavit regarding the project in the Bombay High Court. The affidavit stated that the tender process for the Dharavi redevelopment project was “absolutely transparent” and “no undue favour” was given to the highest bidder, Adani Group.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

He made the remarks while addressing the Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra in Sanand, Gujarat’s Ahmedabad district. Addressing the gathering in Gujarati, Home Minister Shah said, “In 2002, there were riots and thereafter Modi saheb taught a lesson to not repeat the act. Have there been riots thereafter? The rioters were taught such a lesson in 2002 that to date no one dares to cause riots in Gujarat.”ચાંગોદર, સાણંદ (ગુજરાત) ખાતે 'વિકસિત ભારત સંકલ્પ યાત્રા'માં જનતા સાથે સંવાદ… https://t.co/W5WTKGanLHHe also listed out the major achievements of the Modi government in the last nine-and-a-half years and credited the Prime Minister for abrogating Article 370 “in a jiffy”. He lauded PM Modi for improving the safety of the country and highlighted the recurrent bomb blasts across the country before 2014. Shah also highlighted the construction of Bhavya Ram Mandir which was otherwise housed in a ‘tent’. He added, “PM Narendra Modi worked to secure India by carrying out surgical strikes on Pakistan, realised the incomplete dream of abrogation of Article 370, undertook the work of constructing Lord Ram temple in Ayodhya, took India to the Moon through Chandrayaan mission, improved economic parameters to their best since independence, and led to the highest industrial development since independence.” Shah further noted, “Earlier, every day, we would have bomb blasts, print journalists would forget to print, and there would be so many blasts with no end to it. But with a surgical and air strike once, we taught Pakistan a lesson…Narendrabhai has made the country safer.”The Home Minister asserted, “The entire world reached the Moon but our flag could not. Narendrabhai sent Chandrayaan to the Moon and at Shivshakti point made our tricolour fly high. He has worked such that in the country’s economy, all parameters have been at their best in the past 75 years. If one takes 10-year intervals, industrial development has been the most during Narendrabhai’s tenure.” However, Shah argued that improving the quality of life of 60 crore poor people in the country has been the biggest achievement of the Narendra Modi government.“Several times, journalists ask me as to which of Narendra Modi’s achievements will get my highest marks. I say this without any controversy, confusion or dilemma that if I have to give the highest marks, then it will be Modi’s work to improve the quality of life of 60 crore poor,” he was quoted saying by The New Indian Express.Meanwhile, during the Sanand gram panchayat event, Shah also urged people to take a pledge to transform India into a developed country by 2047 while eradicating the “slavery mentality from its root”.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"16 December, 2023 ",PM Modi’s degree case: Gujarat court junks Kejriwal’s plea against nod to prosecute him in defamation complaint filed by Gujarat University,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/gujarat-court-junks-kejriwals-plea-against-prosecution-in-defamation-case-filed-by-gujarat-university/,"The court of additional chief metropolitan magistrate SJ Panchal rejected Arvind Kejriwal's plea, noting that no such sanction was required. On Friday (15th December), a metropolitan court in Gujarat rejected Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s plea opposing criminal prosecution in the defamation complaint filed by Gujarat University. The metropolitan court observed that there is no need for prior approval for his trial in this case, as the remarks made by the politician do not seem to have been made as part of the discharge of official duty.Notably, AAP National Convener Arvind Kejriwal and AAP Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh are facing trial in connection with a criminal defamation complaint filed by the registrar of Gujarat University Piyush Patel. The complaint pertains to their “sarcastic” and “derogatory” statements made in connection with PM Modi’s educational degree.Citing provisions of Section 197 of the CrPC, Kejriwal had sought protection asserting that a sanction was required to initiate a trial against him because he is a public servant.However, the court of additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate SJ Panchal rejected his plea, noting that no such sanction was required. The matter will now be heard on the next date set on 28th December.Earlier on 13th December, the AAP Supremo had filed an application before Panchal’s court. In his plea, the AAP leader challenged his prosecution in the matter as he is a public servant. His advocates had argued that since there was no permission from the proper authority to start a criminal case against him, the trial was not valid. They claimed that the comments were made as part of a public servant’s duty to ask questions.Gujarat University’s counsel Amit Nair opposed the application and asserted that Kejriwal made defamatory statements about the university and tarnished the image of the institution. He submitted that utterance of defamatory words does not fall under the category of discharge on official function and hence, such a sanction was not required in the present case. Additionally, on 13th December, magistrate Panchal had also rejected Kejriwal and co-accused Sanjay Singh’s applications that sought adjournment of proceedings in the defamation case. The court observed that prima facie there appeared to be a case against them under section 500 (defamation) of the Indian Penal Code(IPC) and had summoned the duo. The case against the AAP leaders was filed by GU registrar Piyush Patel following their comments, which came in response to the Gujarat High Court overturning the Chief Information Commissioner’s order regarding the PM’s degree.The complainant asserted that the AAP leaders made “defamatory” statements in press conferences and on their Twitter(now X), handles targeting the university over Modi’s degree. He said that their comments targeting Gujarat University were defamatory and hurt the prestige of the educational institution which has established its name among members of the public. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"14 December, 2023 ","N Ram pats his own back for a pompous, gassy editorial in The Hindu, The Wire has a monumental meltdown: Fallout of SC decision...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/n-ram-pompous-editorial-the-hindu-the-wire-meltdown-sc-decision-article-370/,"N.Ram, Siddarth Varadarajan and their ilk know very well that the Parliament can split or not split a state even when there is an elected government in place and the legislature wishes otherwise.On December 11th, the Supreme Court upheld the abolition of the dreaded Article 370 (I know it was repealed and therefore while Article 370 still exists in the Constitution, the original dreaded purpose for which it was intended doesn’t exist anymore). Certain sections of the English media; certain sections of the I.N.D.I alliance and the entire Congress party went bonkers over this decision of the Supreme Court. Watching their meltdowns gave me goosebumps, literally. Am sure that their WhatsApp groups buzzed with messages on what should be their best strategy on this topic. The line of argument they have chosen to bombard their readers/viewers is – Attack on Federalism! A long, pompous and gassy editorial was published in his newspaper, The Hindu (we will get it later in this article). N. Ram showed utmost humility and described his editorial as “clear-sighted and insightful”. A former CEO of The Hindu group of publications, Rajiv C. Lochan, dared to call out this humility of N.Ram on Twitter here (“Beware when one pats one’s own back”. He went on to comment that “the pervasive use of adjectives can’t strengthen a relatively weak set of arguments”. Rajiv Lochan was telling N. Ram that just because he used good English doesn’t mean that this editorial is insightful. Now, the unparalleled arrogance of N. Ram is well known. Occasionally he takes it upon himself to prove it yet again to all his readers. Rajiv Lochan provided the best opportunity for N. Ram to exhibit his famed arrogance and intolerance in public. True to his image, N. Ram use a lot of English words to convey a simple meaning. I would urge you to read the image below and have a hearty laugh at N. Ram’s meltdown! He is telling Rajiv Lochan that a mere CEO should shut up because there is no one better than N.Ram to have opinions in this whole world. How can a mere CEO comment in public about matters as trivial as Article 370? Imagine N. Ram’s attitude towards mere citizens if he goes bombastic like this on his former CEO! After reading the “clear-sighted and insightful” editorial about 3 to 5 times, I was able to find 2 sentences that summarized the arguments of the entire English media gang. The title of the editorial makes it sound like doomsday is near and we will die because of what the Supreme Court did! I have highlighted the relevant portion in the editorial that tells us that Parliament can now do anything while keeping a state under the President’s rule. This was what his compatriots at The Wire were also shrieking about. The meltdown at The Wire was even more monumental in proportions. Multiple opinion pieces popped up in a short time – all telling us the same thing – that there is no difference left between “democracy and dictatorship”; that there are “Serious implications” for the entire country; that this is an “attack on the basic structure of federalism”; and the best of all – Many “locals had feared” that they have been pushed into “meaningful silence”!Think about what these people are writing folks. What is wrong with “meaningful silence”? What is wrong with anything that is classified as “meaningful”? How can you use the word “meaningful” as a consequence of having “fear” to want it? N.Ram, Siddarth Varadarajan and their ilk know very well that the Parliament can split or not split a state even when there is an elected government in place and the legislature wishes otherwise. When she was the CM of UP, Mayawati passed a resolution in the UP Assembly asking the centre to split into 4 states. The then Home Minister flatly rejected the resolution. The disastrous manner in which AP was split into TS and AP is still fresh in many minds. The AP Legislature resolved that the state should not be split. Did that stop Sonia Gandhi from taking a stand otherwise? Examples galore exist on this topic. Starting from 1956 when their hero Nehru suspended the first elected communist government in the world in Kerala using a “brute majority” in Parliament. We can further discuss the language of Articles 1,2 and 3 in the Constitution of India. It wouldn’t serve any purpose for these people. We are approaching 10 years of Modi government. Despite their wonderful knowledge of the English language, these editors and owners have not been able to find new words, in the past 10 years, to describe their contempt towards the people of India for electing Modi. By rehashing the same words, and in the garb of being “insightful” and “clear-sighted”, all that these people have succeeded in was to show us how blinded they are to the reality of a new emerging Bharat. A Bharat that will embrace all meaningful decisions and leave behind all the meaningless trash these people dish out every day. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"13 December, 2023 ","As TV reporters shamelessly fight for smoke canister thrown in Parliament, here are a few things we should all be worried about after witnessing...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/journalists-fight-colour-canister-parliament-few-things-we-should-be-worried-about/,"If one truly thinks about it, the current TV journalists are merely following the standards set by veteran journalists like Rajdeep Sardesai who admitted that they were like vultures. On the 13th of December 2023, there was a serious security breach in the Parliament of India. Two individuals hurled a smoke canister from the viewer gallery. They then jumped to the floor of the house and were trying to make their way towards the speaker when were overpowered by parliamentarians. Thereafter they were detained by the police and taken for interrogation. Just as the security breach took place, there were two individuals outside the parliament protesting with similar colour smoke canisters. According to preliminary information from the Delhi Police, there is no terror angle to the incidents, however, the police are taking the breach seriously. According to reports, the intruder inside the parliament was chanting slogans about “Kaala Kanoon” and the protestors outside the Parliament were chanting slogans like Jai Bhim, Tanashahi Nahi Chalegi, Manipur ko Insaf do, etc. While the country was shocked by the serious security breach and the ramifications of the lapse, Indian media was conducting their very own circus. A video emerged where TV journalists were seen fighting like animals over the smoke canister that was hurled by the protestors. In the video put out by TV9, their journalist was showing the smoke canister on camera. While he was doing his segment, other journalists started trying to snatch the canister saying that he had used it enough and should hand over the canister to other journalists. When the other journalists started trying to snatch the canister, the TV9 journalist was seen almost sprinting with it, trying to get a few more seconds with the canister – for the sake of the hard-hitting coverage of the unfolding incident at the Parliament. As the nation had important questions that the media should have been focussing on – like how this security breach took place, who were the intruders, what were they chanting, why they did what they did, what was the police doing and how visitors entered the parliament with canisters and why were the Delhi Police so lackadaisical in arrested the protestors outside the Parliament, almost looking like they were taking them for a walk, these elements in the media seemed far more interested in ridiculous sensationalism and showing visuals of the canister. While we watched this circus unfold, there are several important aspects that people need to be extremely worried about. First and foremost, one has to wonder about the priorities of the media and what they choose to cover when important events unfold. As mentioned, there are very important questions that need to be answered as this security breach unfolds. The Parliament is not just a building but a symbol of the democracy of India and the seat of power. Any attack on the Parliament is an attack on democracy and the sovereignty of India itself. While these events unfolded, the journalists on the ground should have been far more focused on bringing crucial details to the people of the nation. And while several journalists were doing so, some were indulging in cheap sensationalism. This, however, comes as no surprise. One is reminded of the time when Rajdeep Sardesai was talking about the 2001 Parliament Attack – the terrorist attack that incidentally took place on this day 22 years ago. In 2018, a video had gone viral where Rajdeep Sardesai admitted that journalists were vultures. Sardesai in the video recounted the December 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament where he and his crew were preparing for a picnic owing to a slow news day. Preparing for a feast in the garden near the Parliament, he and his team entered the Parliament at around 11 am. Within minutes of the team entering the Parliament, he says they heard gunshots. The Parliament was attacked. He then recalled that when his colleague asked him to leave, he directed him to suggest the guard to close the gates. He explained with a wide grin that he did so so that no other channel crew could enter. Those days there were fewer channels and Sardesai was excited at the prospect of doing an exclusive story.He then says how the exclusive story of the parliament attack made the team forget the wine and kababs they were planning to picnic on. “It was a great day. We are like vultures. We feed on these moments.” he added.If one truly thinks about it, the current TV journalists are merely following the standards set by veteran vultures like Rajdeep Sardesai. While the conduct of the media was abysmal, what is far more concerning is the conduct of the Delhi Police and security agencies. When a security breach like this has taken place, one would imagine that the police and law enforcement agencies would ask the media to stand back – after all, 26/11 was a classic case of how the media could potentially jeopardise any rescue operation and investigation when such incidents take place. During the Mumbai Attack, the police allowed unbridled access to the media, resulting in journalists like Barkha Dutt potentially giving away crucial information on hostages from ISI handlers who were closely monitoring the media. Taking a lesson from the past, the police should have summarily kept the media away. That canister itself could be crucial evidence that the police need, instead, the media was yet again given unbridled access to play with the canister as if were some sort of a prop in a drama. On the 22nd anniversary of the ghastly 2001 Parliament attack, the parliament was under severe threat. There were Khalistani and other terror organisations which had issued threats against the Parliament. While now the police are claiming that the smoke was not harmful, while the breach was ongoing, the police had to function under the assumption that it could be a deadly terror attack which could have dire ramifications. Despite that, the media was given unbridled access knowing fully well that such media has a history of creating a circus during serious incidents. Several other questions are being raised against the police as the Parliament’s security was breached. Visitors to the Parliament are frisked at every stage and there are now questions being asked as to how the security could have been so wanting that two individuals with smoke canisters could enter the Parliament. Per protocol, those who have passes to view the Parliament proceedings are not allowed to carry a paper inside the Parliament.

"11 December, 2023 ",Chadar of sanitised history over ugly side of ‘Sufi saints’: I got death threats by Islamists for talking about historical facts – so let...,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/nupur-j-sharma-moinuddin-chisti-sufi-saints-demand-arrest-threats-statement/,"Since the Islamists have been relentlessly demanding my arrest, I must place on record that if needed, I will be more than willing to defend my position in a court of law.On the 2nd of December, I interviewed the Son of Hamas – Mosab Hassan Yousef. He is the son of one of the founders of Hamas Sheikh Hassan Yousef. The interview was necessitated after a Hindu boy from Kashmir started getting Sar Tan Se Juda threats after he shared an old interview snippet of Yousef, where he was talking about Islam. After the boy from NIT Srinagar was threatened by the Islamist mob, Yousef took to his X page and posted that the Jihadis should go after him and leave the boy alone. In his interview with me, he categorically said that if anyone touched the Hindu boy, the repercussions would be dire. Beyond the NIT Srinagar case, Yousef and I also spoke at length about Islam, Islamism and the fate of the rest of the world in the face of a cult that was perpetually offended and believed that the use of violence to express that offence was their divine right – nay – duty. During the discussion, Yousef mentioned how Sufism was one of the most peaceful, spiritual branches of Islam. A Hindu, however, knows that this statement rings hollow. I told Yousef that as a Hindu, I find it difficult to make sense of that perception since Hindus have been raped and murdered by Sufis. As an example of the Sufi onslaught against Hindus, I cited the example of Moinuddin Chisti, how cows were slaughtered and Hindu Temples desecrated and also alluded to the Ajmer Dargah rape scandal where the self-proclaimed descendants of Moinuddin Chisti and the custodians of his legacy raped hundreds of Hindu girls and blackmailed them – a sordid saga from 1992. It is pertinent to mention here that I don’t blame Mosab Hassan Yousef for the views he holds on Sufism. Many Hindus themselves believe that Sufism is peaceful and spiritual. In fact, a chunk of the business that the Amer Dargah gets is from Hindus who visit the shrine – not Muslims. Even though it was some of the Chistis associated with the Ajmer Dargah who had issued death threats to Nupur Sharma and called for her beheading. Khadim Gauhar Chishti of Ajmer Dargah had links to Kanhaiya Lal’s murder. Khadim of Ajmer Dargah named Gauhar Chishti had met one of the killers of the Hindu tailor. Ajmer Dargah Khadim Salman Chishti threatened to kill Nupur Sharma. The history-sheeter with over 13 cases filed against him, including murder and attempt to murder, claimed that he would hand over his house to anyone who brings Sharma’s head. Sarwar Chishti of the Anjuman Committee of the Ajmer dargah had said “The situation in the country right now, is such that people are committing blasphemy. They are doing mischief in the glory of the Prophet, in the glory of the Khwaja. We will not tolerate this at all. We will launch such a massive agitation that the whole Hindustan will shake.” Sarwar Chishti had called himself a member of the PFI. In 2020, he defended PFI saying the organisation was ”saving India’s constitution”. He had also called for a boycott of Hindus. Syed Aadil Chishti – son of Sarwar Chishti – mocked Hindu deities after the Nupur Sharma incident.Nothing I said was historically inaccurate and I will come to that. Days after the interview, a clip where I mentioned Moinuddin Chisti was shared on social media by Islamists, claiming that I had insulted the Sufi ‘saint’ and I should be arrested. What started with the hashtag #ArrestNupurJSharma soon turned into a free-for-all – I got death threats, rape threats and the usual ‘Sar Tan se Juda’ threats. My reaction was the chuckle at the irony of it all. After all, my statement came just as it was being claimed that Sufis are peaceful and spiritual – a model for all Muslims to follow. Here is a sneak peak into their spiritual moorings: While the peaceful Sufis demanded for my head and arrest, I held my peace for 3 days – not because I was scared but because I believed that their outrage would die down. It did not. I believe sunlight is the best disinfectant. I believe the truth – historical facts – can’t be suppressed simply because some people are offended by it. As an American conservative says, ‘facts don’t care about your feelings’. I have repeated over and over again the purpose of my professional existence – I picked up my pen because ‘they’ sold theirs. I would not do justice to my role or my readers if I don’t stand by the truth. If I cower today. And therefore, I feel it necessary to substantiate my statement with historical evidence. With regards to Sufism, there is a broad perception that it is a peaceful, spiritual sect of Islam. However, there are certain myths attached to this notion that need honest conversation. Historically, several genocides against Hindus and crimes against their faith/places of worship have been led by Sufis or have been conducted at the behest of Sufis. It is a matter of historical record that eighteenth-century Sufi preacher Shah Waliullah’s letters to Islamic rulers and nobles show that he was very keen on rejuvenating Islamic supremacy in Delhi, which had started to loosen its grip over the sub-continent after Aurangzeb’s death. According to the book by Saiyid Athar Abbas Rizvi, Shah Waliullah wrote a letter to Ahmad Shah Abdali, the invader from Afghanistan, inviting him to India to establish Islamic supremacy by suppressing Hindus.From the invite to Ahmad Shah Abdali to the mastermind of the Noakhali genocide belonging to a Sufi sect – Shah Syed Gholam Sarwar Husseini, the hereditary pir of Dayra Sharif, a Sufi shrine in Noakhali, Sufism has a chequered history – one which is well documented – a history of genocide, enslavement, forced conversion and establishment of the supremacy of Islam. Those Sufis who refused to adhere to Orthodox Islam were persecuted – the sects we talk about today were not. MA Khan writes that Sufi leaders had poured into India along with the Turkic invaders and most of them, Nizamuddin Aulia, Aamir Khasrau, Nasiruddin Chiragh, Moinuddin Chishti and Jalaluddin etc, were all known for holding the Ulemas, orthodox Islamic scholars in high esteem. Khan further writes that though Nizamuddin Aulia and Moinuddin Chishti were among the most unorthodox when it came to music and dance, in the matters of Islam and Islamic supremacy, they held the words of the Ulema as sacrosanct. “What the Ulema seeks to achieve through speech, the Sufis achieve by behaviour,” Nizamuddin Aulia had said.The great Sufi saint Nasiruddin Chiragh had reportedly banned all practices that were deviant from the Sharia. Khan quotes Prof KA Nizami to describe what the Sufi leader Ghazzali had told in terms of Jihad, the Islamic religious war against Kafirs. Ghazzali had written that his followers must go on Jihad at least once a year and should bring down the fortresses of non-Muslims, they should cut down their throats drown them and burn their holy books. Jihadists may take whatever booty they desire. Toeing the orthodox line, Nizamuddin Aulia had condemned the Hindus of India to the ‘fires of hell’. He had also written that even if non-Muslims embrace Islam, the faith will not benefit them, because they had been unbelievers. He had added, “He, (Allah) has created paradise and hell for the believers and the infidels respectively to repay the wicked they (infidels) have done.” Now, coming to the specific comments in question about Moinuddin Chisti – one made during an interview with the Son of Hamas – Mosab Hassan Yousef. It is necessary to place on record that in the full video interview uploaded on YouTube, the mention of Moinuddin Chisti had long been redacted. Let me explain why. When I asked the question about Sufism and Hindus, I intended to talk about the campaign of certain Sufis against Hindus – which has been documented throughout history – even as recently as 1992. In the video description, I have explained that when I spoke of rape, I was referring to the Ajmer Dargah Rape scandal where hundreds of Hindu girls were raped with the active connivance and participation of the Khadims of Ajmer Dargah – the Chistis – who claim to be the descendants of Moinuddin Chisti. Farooq Chisti was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2007, but in 2013, the Rajasthan High Court deemed he had served ‘enough’ time and therefore, released him. The Ajmer Dargah still associates itself with him and his local clout has remained intact. Nafis Chist was absconding until 2003, before being caught by the Delhi Police while trying to escape, wearing a burqa. He is currently out on bail and respected in a similar way in Ajmer. These are facts. In the second part of the question, I spoke about cows being slaughtered and thrown into Hindu temples. I also spoke about the desecration of Hindu temples and the Jihad waged by Moinuddin Chisti – this assertion is again documented in history. Here is an excerpt from the book “Islamic Jihad” by MA Khan. Khan writes further that every day, Khwaja’s followers used to bring a cow and they used to slaughter it near a prominent temple where the local Raja and Hindus used to pray, cook kebabs from the cow’s meat to eat, just to show contempt towards the local Hindus. Chishti had come to India to fight Jihad on the side of the Sultan Muhammad Ghauri against the Hindu King Prithviraj Chauhan. Chishti had credited himself for Prithviraj’s capture, writing, “We have seized Pithaura (Prithviraj) and handed him to the army of Islam.” In addition, this is what a previous version of the website of Ajmer Dargah itself said and I quote, “When he had settled down in Ajmer, the Khawaja Sahib had a special reminder about his marriage through a ‘Basharat’ (prophetic dream) from the Holy prophet sometime in 590 AH or 1193 AD. The Prophet said, “O Moinuddin, You are a great preceptor of our religion. You should not depart from our ‘sunnah’ (meaning marriage which is incumbent upon every Muslim under the laws of Shariat). Coincidentally that very night Malik-a-Khitab devotee of Hazrat Khawaja Sahib, had captured a Raja’s daughter in an encounter who embraced Islam and Khawaja sahib, in response to the above reminder, married her giving her the Islamic name of Bibi Ummutulla..” Here is an archive link to the page: https://web.archive.org/web/20180319103851/http://dargahajmer.com/married-life/ This is also substantiated in A History Of Sufism in India, Sayyad Athar Abbas Rizvi, Vol 1, pg. 124. However, since the snippet in the video was not an explainer and merely a question, I realized it may be misinterpreted and therefore, the mention of the individual was removed. It bodes well, however, to repeat on record that I stand by the rest of my statement. Since the Islamists have been relentlessly demanding my arrest, I must place on record that if needed, I will be more than willing to defend my position in a court of law.It is said that the most effective way to destroy people is to deny and obliterate their own understanding of their history. For what little my contribution is worth, I refuse to be a part of that obliteration – I will not be silenced. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"10 December, 2023 ","Antisemitism is not new to US campuses including Ivy Leagues, their credibility is questionable for more reasons than one. Here’s why",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/antisemitism-not-new-to-us-campuses-their-credibility-questionable/,"While several academic institutes across America, both Ivy League and, public and private, saw a dramatic rise in hostility against Jewish students, these have turned out to be symptoms of an underlying disease.A mix of Georgian and Victorian-era inspired academic buildings are spread across the Northeastern United States. Besides the entitled exclusivity in the admissions process, the unreasonable fee structure and the decorated syllabus, there is also a sadistic appeal to the Gothic appearance these institutions boast of.But, to quote Shakespeare, all that glitters is not gold.The holier-than-thou attitude over the decades of US’s Ivy Leagues – touted as the world’s most esteemed and prestigious universities – was brought to its knees when presidents of two of the three universities, Harvard and Penn, and the third being the high-ranking MIT, refused to condemn calls for genocide of Jews at a congressional hearing on 5th December.On 5th December, a congressional hearing on “Holding Campus Leaders Accountable and Confronting Antisemitism” was held in Washington, D.C.At the hearing, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik confronted the Presidents of Harvard University, University of Pennsylvania and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).Her specific yes or no question to them was, “Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate your university’s rules or code of conduct regarding bullying or harassment?”MIT President Sally Kornbluth responded saying that “if targeted at individuals and not making public statements”. When asked for a yes or no answer, Kornbluth said that she has not heard calls for the genocide of Jews on MIT campus.The Congresswoman questioned, “But you have chants for intifada?” To this, Kornbluth replied, “I have heard chants which can be antisemitic depending on the context when calling for the elimination of the Jewish people.”She said that such calls would be investigated as harassment only “if pervasive and severe”.President (now former) of University of Pennsylvania, Liz Magill’s response came with wide smiles and smirks. She said, “If the speech turns into conduct it can be harassment, yes.”When questioned again, Magill said that if such speech is directed and severe and pervasive, it is harassment. When asked if she means a yes, Magill said it is a context-dependent decision.She maintained that “if the speech becomes conduct, it is harassment”. Magill finally responded with a yes after much struggle. President of Harvard, Dr Claudine Gay reiterated the same chorus in answer to the question.“It (the call for genocide of Jews) can be (violate rules) depending on the context,” Dr Gay said. When asked what the context is she said, “targeted as an individual, targeted at an individual.”“Antisemitic rhetoric when it crosses into conduct, it amounts to bullying, harassment, intimidation, that is actionable conduct and we do take action,” Dr Gay said.The roughly 3 minute 31 second long video of the hearing took social media by the storm prompting angry responses from netizens. The matter has escalated with key stakeholders demanding accountability from the presidents of the respective universities.President Liz Magill of University of Penn has resigned amid mounting pressure.The focus of the hearing by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce was the rise in cases of antisemitism reported on campuses across the US and the universities’ response to the same.This comes in the backdrop of the 7th October terrorist attack by Palestinian group Hamas on Israel killing at least 1,400 people and kidnapping more than 200 to Gaza. Israel has since vowed to avenge the death of its people and has launched an all-out offensive against the terrorist group.A selective support for Palestinians toeing the Hamas line has since mushroomed in campuses across the United States. In the name of human rights of Palestinians, the terrorist attack by Hamas on Israel has been justified on the campuses of these so-called prestigious institutions with absolutely no repercussions from the administration.On 11th October, four days after the brutal attack on Israel, a group of Harvard students submitted a letter in support of Palestine. This prompted several corporate institutions, particularly those with Jewish heads, warning Harvard that they will not hire students supporting Hamas. Several Jewish donors to the universities also threatened to withdraw their donations.On 25th October, Jewish students at Cooper Union college in New York had to be locked inside library for their own safety as pro-Palestinian students tried to break down the door chanting “Free Palestine”. The Jewish students had to be escorted out through tunnels using the back door.On 18th October, a “Stop the genocide in Gaza” die-in demonstration was reportedly organised by the Harvard Business School. A video from the demonstration showed a Jewish student mobbed by pro-Palestinian demonstrators screaming “shame, shame, shame”.On 24th October, an antisemitic slogan was displayed on the wall of the library of George Washington University. It read, “Free Palestine From The River To The Sea.” Another message read, “Glory to our martyrs” and one read, “End the siege on Gaza”.While several academic institutes across America, both Ivy League and, public and private, saw a dramatic rise in hostility against Jewish students, these have turned out to be symptoms of an underlying disease.A complaint letter via e-mail by the Jewish rights group ‘Brandeis Center’ to the University of Pennsylvania alleged that the latter had allowed its campus to become a hostile environment for Jewish students and a magnet for antisemites.It pointed to a festival that was organised by the university titled “Palestine Writes Festival” which hosted antisemitic speakers. Notably, this festival came days before the terrorist attacks proving the antisemitism is pre-existing sentiment on campuses in the US.The letter read, “In the days leading up to the September Festival, anti-Semitic graffiti and a Penn student’s violent attack on Penn’s Hillel signaled trouble to come for Jewish students and institutions on campus.”Surprisingly, the festival was organised on the same day as the Jewish festival ‘Jewish High Holy Days of Awe”. Meanwhile, Magill, despite concerns raised by several members, stood by the event citing “free speech”.Even now, as recently as 9th December (Saturday), Jewish students in the Penn University are being subjected to chants like “We are Hamas” whereas openly antisemitic professors and staff are still employed with the university.Forget even the recent decades, antisemitism on US campuses goes back nearly a century. In the 1950s, Stanford University reportedly tried to limit the proportion of its Jewish students.Stanford University is located on the West Coast of the US and is not an Ivy League university but ranks higher than Ivy League varsities.Another report reveals that the Seth Low Junior College (SLJC) near the Columbia University was “created with the explicit goal of reducing the amount of Jewish students on the CU campus”. It was built in the early 20th century.As per the report, the “enrollment of Jewish students at Columbia College after Seth Low Junior College’s opening dropped from 40 to 25 per cent”. Moreover, on one hand, half of the total Columbia College applicants were accepted, only one in six Jewish applicants were admitted in the early 20th century.This was reportedly the case in most East Coast schools in the US.One might think that on-campus antisemitism is an elephantine problem which dwarfs any other controversies surrounding academic campuses in America.Not really. The political invasion of campuses in America which is being exposed with hatred for Jews and Israel has only compounded their already declining credibility.The larger-than-life projected image of these institutions in the US has been a facade which has been maintained through endowments, donations and charities flowing in like dirt, open political biases, crippling admissions fees thereby giving academic access to only a handful, racial and gender persecution, and woke agendas.You’d be surprised, if not shocked, to know that it was only in June this year that the US Supreme Court ruled that universities can no longer determine race as grounds for admissions.Up till the US SC verdict, race was still very much a part of the admissions process in the United States centered around the idea of “positive discrimination”.And yet, the move was decried by the left-liberal media in the US as the end of “affirmative action”.Racism has been rampant, like a regular petty crime, on US campuses including the so-called esteemed campuses. This has only served to fan left wing politics in the US where voices are raised prominently when incidents involve a black victim.But when Asian or Indian students are subjected to racism, the same woke left wing crowd goes into hiding. Safe to say, US campuses are not merely dealing with crimes of unabated racism but several politicised versions of it.In 2020, Princeton University had acknowledged that systemic racism exists on its campus following which an investigation was launched by the Trump administration.Columbia University graduate Emma Sulkowicz made headlines in 2015 by staging a protest based on performance art against alleged sexual harassment.Sulkowicz walked around the campus carrying a 50-pound mattress and across the stage during her graduation to symbolise the weight carried around by victims of sexual assault.She had alleged that she was sexually assaulted by a classmate of rape during her sophomore year in 2013. The accused was cleared of the charges following a hearing by the university.In 2017, three professors in Dartmouth’s department of psychological and brain sciences were accused of sexual abuse and misconduct. The professors reportedly resigned or retired following recommendations for dismissal.However, the seven women who levelled the charges alleged that the college had failed to protect its students from sexual harassment and sexual assault.A scandal broke out in Cornell University last year exposing alleged incidents of sexual assault and druggings at off-campus fraternity parties. A crime alert was issued early in November 2022 by the campus police responding to four different reports of students being drugged and at least once case of sexual assault.In May 2022, a longtime professor at Princeton named Joshua Katz was suspended after investigation revealed that he had sex with one of his undergraduate students years ago.In 2021, several complaints surfaced against the professor from mid-2000s alleging disturbing cases of allegedly propositioning undergraduates for sexual relationships.In 1986, a shocking scandal was uncovered in Brown University wherein students were allegedly linked to a sex worker ring in Providence. Multiple students were charged with sex work crimes and drug possession.According to The Washington Post, Harvard in 2022 warned all undergraduate students that “cisheterosexism,” “fatphobia” and “using the wrong pronouns” amounted to “abuse” and perpetuated “violence” on campus.In May this year, the student government at the Northwestern University in Illinois “indefinitely” froze the funds of the College Republicans over an event poster showing conservative speaker James Lindsay, critical of transgenderism.After an uproar that has been dragging in the US over participation of trans athletes in women’s sports, a bill was approved by the House Republicans in April this year barring such transgender athletes whose biological sex awas assigned at birth as male from competing on girls’ or women’s sports teams.As if the use of a thousand pronouns for individually-preferred “gender” identification has not disadvantaged academically-focused students enough, transgenders participating against females in sports has most definitely put the latter at a physical disadvantage.High-profile names involving celebrities and politicians and their aides were at the center of a massive admissions scandal across universities.College athletics coaches and test administrators accepted bribes and donations in exchange for recruiting students. The mastermind, William Rick Singer, was paid a whopping $25 million by celebrity parents to bribe coaches and university administrators to designate their children as purported athletic recruits to facilitate their admission.Singer allegedly created fake charities to facilitate money for “donations” to various colleges including Yale University, Georgetown, Stanford and the University of Southern California.The big names involved in the scandal include Lori Loughlin, Felicity Huffman, Mossimo Giannulli, William H Macy, Michelle Janavs and many more. One of the more prominent names is Gordon Ernst, former Georgetown University tennis coach known for having coached the Obamas.In 2022, a professor at Columbia University, Michael Thaddeus, published a paper accusing the varsity of manipulating data to project that it spent more on research and instruction than it actually did.This, reportedly, in turn is suspected to have played a role in the Ivy League institution’s jump in the rankings. The university later admitted that they had reported incorrect data but refused to admit that it was done to improve rankings.As per the professor’s report, the varsity’s rankings moved up from no. 18 in 1988 to no 2 by 2022. Following the controversy, Columbia, Yale and Harvard announced that they would no longer participate in the rankings in the future.The rise of wokeism on university campuses in US can easily be attributed to left-wing bias. In fact, it can be considered a branch of the same tree.According to a poll, Republicans have the least amount of confidence (19%) in higher education in the United States whereas Democrats have the highest level of confidence at 59%.Another related survey reportedly found that 77% of college presidents in the US agree that the perception of colleges as intolerant of conservative views has impacted people’s attitudes about higher education.According to a report, US universities have been receiving funding from Qatar particularly in the period between 2001 and 2021, “precisely after the September 11 attacks”.As per the report based on a study published in 2022, a staggering $4.7 billion was injected into universities in the United States. Moreover, the recipients did not report part of the money received as required by the law.“Qatar has reportedly become the largest foreign donor to American academic in the two decades since 9/11,” the report reads.In 2020, the Trump administration alleged that top US universities have “massively underreported” foreign funding from China, Russia and other nations described as “foreign adversaries”.According to another report, Saudi Arabia owned oil company ARAMCO has been funding programmes in US universities like Princeton since as early as the 1950s. Moreover, Middle East studies programme in US institutions reportedly receive specifically from Arab countries to “advance their political agendas”.“I don’t think there’s any doubt that the Saudis have seen such donations as a way to acquire goodwill, legitimacy and support in U.S. academia,” the report quotes NYU professor Zachary Lockman. Interestingly, it must be noted that some of the biggest names like George Soros and the Rothschilds, which bestow donations in billions to the US acadmia, are Jewish. And it is thus a wonder as to how these institutions, funded equally well by the left-liberal globalist disruptors like their Middle Eastern counterparts, have been unable to counter antisemitism. Yet, when questions are raised against these conglomerates, they coin the term antisemitism through their rights groups and NGOs in their defence.All in all, Universities in the US are too good to be true for their realities have been exposed for all to see since a long time. It is time to stop trusting every colonial infrastructure just because they put on a good show of elitist exclusivity. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"7 December, 2023 ","How The Hindu consoled itself and shielded Rahul Gandhi after electoral drubbing in 3 states: Blaming regional leaders, voters, Hindutva and more",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/the-hindu-shields-rahul-gandhi-electoral-loss-3-states-regional-leaders-voters-hindutva/,"The Gandhi family must realise how faithful the editors and owners of The Hindu are towards them and make such great efforts to make them look good. The effort the writers at The Hindu put up in finding new phrases and words to describe their disgust towards the voters is praiseworthy! By now, we are all used to the Congress party leaders crediting the Gandhi family for victories and blaming the regional leaders for their defeats. It is understandable why they are forced to do this. However, it is baffling that certain newspapers, that claim to be brave, daring, unbiased and whatnot, also willingly resorted to this same argument. Just to shield the Gandhi family.The Congress party lost in Rajasthan (RJ), Madhya Pradesh (MP) and Chhattisgarh (CG) in the just concluded elections to these states. The Hindu, in a great show of loyalty towards the Gandhi family, asks us – Did overconfident regional leaders in the Hindi heartland pay no heed to Congress top brass?We are told by the author that in these three states, “heavyweights took independent decisions often ignoring the high command”. Are we to seriously believe there are people in Congress who are capable of ignoring the Gandhi family and making decisions? The author cites the example of Kamal Nath cancelling an I.N.D.I Alliance meeting in Bhopal. Are we to believe that Rahul Gandhi had no role in the cancellation of such a meeting? However, in my opinion, the best argument by the author was about the CG election. He writes that “Though the AICC did replace over 20 MLAs to beat anti-incumbency, Mr Baghel could not effectively counter the allegations of corruption against his government by the BJP”. Cute, no? The Gandhi family thought their job ended with replacing MLAs. The job of winning the narrative is on the CM only though. Imagine if Congress had won. The same author would have written how the Gandhi family played a master stroke by replacing 20 MLAs! This article is not the only place where The Hindu has given us pearls of wisdom. Their editorial on the results of these elections was even better! We have been told that the victory was because the BJP’s campaign was “laced with communal propaganda” and therefore “had a more effective outreach to subaltern segments”. I like the choice of phrase – subaltern segments. It’s a posh way of insulting the intelligence of the voters. In this particular case, The Hindu is arguing that the voter chose BJP’s communal agenda over Congress’s caste agenda. In its entire (long) editorial, The Hindu makes no mention of governance-based reasons on why the voters were vexed with Congress in RJ and CG where it was in power; and why they didn’t see Congress as an alternative in MP where BJP has been in power for nearly 2 decades now. We are told that Ashok Gehlot is so awesome that even though he lost the election he prevented a complete washout! And just in case you forgot that they told you that the BJP won because of Hindutva, they repeat it once again in their (long) editorial. This time, they accuse women, youth and tribal communities of falling prey to “Hindu identity politics”. I wonder what wrong the men did, to not get this honour! The editorial is severely upset that the caste census idea of Rahul Gandhi did not resonate with the voters. The editorial takes up a lot of space and conveys very little. When you separate the wheat from the chaff, it is baffling how The Hindu always ends up arguing that BJP’s victories are always because of Hindutva and nothing else really matters. How they try to find solace in the performance of the Congress party is also very touching. Their front-page banner story also highlighted how despite losing, they had their vote share intact! I hope the Gandhi family realises how faithful the editors and owners of The Hindu are towards them and make such great efforts to make them look good. The effort the writers at The Hindu put up in finding new phrases and words to describe their disgust towards the voters is really praiseworthy! They have been resorting to the same argument ever since the 2014 Lok Sabha victory changed the political landscape of India. It’s been more than 9 years, but they are yet to get out of the shock! Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"14 December, 2023 ","News24 posts misleading tweet on Muslim sculptors making idol of Ram Lalla, here are the facts on the idols being made for the Ram...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/news24-posts-misleading-tweet-on-muslim-sculptors-making-idol-of-ram-lalla/,"While Muslim sculptor Jamaluddin and his son are making fibre statues of Lord Ram for decorative purposes, News24 claimed they are making Ram Lalla idol to be placed in Ram MandirAs the date for grand opening of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya approaches, various updates about the temple are being reported by the media. However, misleading and fake news are also being published by some media houses regarding the Ram Mandir. One such false information was provided by News24, which claimed that the idol of Ram Lalla to be installed in the temple is being made by a Muslim sculptor and his son.On 14th December, News24 posted a tweet on X, claiming that Muhammad Jamaluddin from West Bengal and his son Bittu are sculpting the idol of Ram Lalla, which will take its place in the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. The tweet in Hindi said, “Ramlalla is ready to sit in the Ram temple of Ayodhya in January.” After that, the media houses added four bullet points, the first of which said, “The idols were made by Mohammad Jamaluddin of Bengal and his son Bittu.”News24 then said in the post that father-son duo has been crafting idols for a long time. The post then added remarks by Jamaluddin, who said, ‘Religion is a personal thing. People following many religions live in our country. The culture of brotherhood is my message as an artiste.’By saying that Jamaluddin and his son are making the idol of Ram Lall to be placed in Ram Mandir, News24 implied that the Muslim duo is making the main idol to placed in the sanctum sanctorum of the temple. But this is completely fake and misleading claim, and no Muslim is making the main idol of Ram Lalla.In fact, other media reports on Jamaluddin make it clear that he is making a decorating idol using fibre for the opening ceremony of Ram Mandir. As per a report by India Today, Mohammed Jamaluddin and his son Bittu have been engaged in creating some statues that will adorn the temple complex. The report stated that he is making life-size fibre statues.Other reports make it clear that the fibre statutes of Lord Ram and other Gods will be used to decorate the temple complex and the Ayodhya City during the inauguration ceremony. TV9 reported that statues of Lord Ram will be placed in major intersections in Ayodhya, and some of these idols are being made by Jamaluddin and his son.After several social media users pointed out the misleading claim made by News24, the media house later deleted the tweet.Fibre idols are generally used for decorative purposes, and they are not used as the main deity in temples. Most deities in Hindu temples are made from various types of stones, while temporary idols made for annual festivals are made using clay. Fibre idols last longer than clay, but are much easier to make compared to carving stone. Fibre idols are generally made for export, as they are lighter and easy to transport with the risk of damage. Notably, not one but three idols of Ram Lalla are being made in Ayodhya by three separate artists, and one of them will be picked by a committee to be placed in Sanctum Santorum, after which the pran pratistha rituals will be conducted by priests. Champat Rai, general secretary of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Trust, had earlier informed that the three different idols are being made by three sculptors – Ganesh Bhatt and Arun Yogiraj from Karnataka and Satyanarayan Pandey from Jaipur. Two of the idols are being made using two stones from Karnataka and one from Rajasthan. Earlier, a stone was brought from Nepal, and later stones were also brought from Odisha and Maharashtra to carve the idol, but those were found not suitable.Ganesh Bhatt of Karnataka is carving out the idol from Nellikaru rock or black stones which is also known as Shyam shila or Krishna shila. Famous sculptor Arun Yogiraj of Mysore, who sculpted the 12-ft statue of Adi Shankaracharya unveiled by PM Modi in Kedarnath, is sculpting another idol using another rock from Karnataka. Satya Narayan Pandey of Rajasthan is carving the Ram Lalla idol from white Makrana marble stones. All three artists are chiselling the idols based on a sketch by renowned artist Vasudeo Kamath from Mumbai.The 51-inch-tall Ram Lalla depicts the child form of Lord Ram, same as the current smaller idol that was placed in the makeshift temple for over half a century. The idol will depict five-year-old Ram Lalla sitting on a lotus, carrying a bow in one hand and an arrow in the other. Many other symbols related to Lord Ram will carved on the statue.While one idol will be selected to be permanently placed in the sanctum sanctorum, the other two idols will be placed in prominent places inside the temple premises.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"22 November, 2023 ","No, Shakib Al Hasan wasn’t beaten up on his return to Bangladesh after the World Cup: Here’s the truth about the viral video",https://www.opindia.com/2023/11/shakib-al-hasan-wasnt-beaten-up-on-his-return-to-bangladesh-after-world-cup-truth-about-the-viral-video/,"An old video of Bangladeshi cricketer Shakib Al-Hasan being beaten up and shoved around is going viral on social media with the claim that the all-rounder had been pushed around on his return to Bangladesh after the World Cup. In the wake of Bangladesh’s poor performance in the World Cup 2023, a video of Shakib Al Hasan being pulled, and thrashed by a mob is going viral on the internet. It is being claimed that the Bangladeshi Captain Shakib was mobbed by angry Bangladeshi fans on his return to the country. The viral video was also shared by some media portals claiming that the Bangladeshi skipper was ‘brutally beaten’/ ‘assaulted’ after the team’s World Cup debacle.  Kalesh b/w Bangladeshi Fans and Shakib al hasan, when he returned to Bangladesh after poor World Cup campaign  pic.twitter.com/C7DQK93gAkThis happened to Shakib when he returned to Bangladesh after poor World Cup campaign Bangladeshi people are top tier ret@rds https://t.co/iFDogEkZCA pic.twitter.com/xKkkyfmLFRJournalist Anil Tiwari who writes for Qatari mouthpiece Aljazeera, as per his Twitter bio, tweeted, “Bangladeshi fans assaulted their captain Shakib Al Hasan. Just yesterday, they were celebrating India’s defeat. Utterly disgraceful behaviour.”Bangladeshi fans assaulted their captain Shakib Al Hasan. Just yesterday, they were celebrating India's defeat. Utterly disgraceful behavior. #CricketWorldCup #Cricket #Bangladesh  pic.twitter.com/bYY9Cn6xBSHere are some headlines from media portals making those claims alongside sharing the viral video. A Cricket portal named OneCricket headlined (Archive) “[Watch] Shakib Al Hasan Gets ‘Brutally Beaten’ By Bangladesh Fans After Horrific World Cup Run”Notably, Bangladesh performed badly and finished in the eighth spot in the recently concluded World Cup, falling way below the fans’ expectations. The Shakib Al Hasan-led side only managed to win 2 games and the skipper himself had an unforgettable outing. He had to bench himself in some games due to injury concerns. However, the claims being made on the basis of the viral videos are fake. The video doing rounds on the internet is an old video. The said incident involving Shakib Al Hasan captured in the video took place in March this year, that is the video is 8 months old. It is not linked with Bangladesh’s poor performance at the World Cup or Shakib’s below-per-performance. Additionally, the Bangladeshi skipper was not assaulted or mobbed on his return to the country after the team’s World Cup debacle, as claimed on the internet.  The incident took place in Dubai on 16th March when Shakib Al Hasan went for a commercial event at a Jewelry store. After his series against England in March this year, Shakib flew to Dubai to inaugurate a gold jewelry shop that was owned by Arav Khan. Khan is a Bangladeshi fugitive and wanted in the murder case of a police official.At the time of the incident, Shakib was surrounded by fans who went out of control and he tried to rush out. However, in the chaos, he almost fell over while fans kept pulling his collar to stop him and take selfies with him. As seen from the video and confirmed by media reports of that time, he had no security around him to keep fans in check.   Regarding the Dubai incident involving Shakib, the Additional commissioner (detective) of Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) told the media that the man (Robiul Islam) who uploaded the video is from Bangladesh. The Police official added that Islam had murdered a police officer and had taken an Indian passport. He noted that the accused then went on to live in Dubai and despite knowing his criminal past Shakib went to his event. It is important to note here that Arav Khan’s original name is Robiul Islam. He hails from Kotalipara in Gopalganj and fled the country after charges of murder.The officer added that as part of the investigation, the Bangladeshi Cricket team’s captain might also be quizzed. Sharing reports and details of the original incident, several Twitter users called out the fake claims being made about Shakib Al Hasan. The users slammed individuals and media outlets for peddling these false claims, particularly those who connected the recent setback for Bangladesh with an older video depicting fans pulling his shirt, falsely portraying it as a case of him being manhandled or assaulted while attempting to take a selfie. This footage from Dubai in purposes of business and the audio was taken from a tv DramaOld news pic.twitter.com/NTb3uviioDFAKE NEWS BUSTED !! #ShakibAlHasanhttps://t.co/W7lwtlO2TaI hope you recover from the hated of your own bitrthland.Fake voice alertThis is a 8 months old video from dubai.where he went for promotion and fans wanted to take it photo with him.Crowd went out of control.Such a disgusting thing that it is morphed by a Bangladeshi Kohli fan pic.twitter.com/89qzTQvfsfSome users accused that the fake claims were peddled by Kohli fans in Bangladesh.

"14 December, 2023 ","News24 posts misleading tweet on Muslim sculptors making idol of Ram Lalla, here are the facts on the idols being made for the Ram...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/news24-posts-misleading-tweet-on-muslim-sculptors-making-idol-of-ram-lalla/,"While Muslim sculptor Jamaluddin and his son are making fibre statues of Lord Ram for decorative purposes, News24 claimed they are making Ram Lalla idol to be placed in Ram MandirAs the date for grand opening of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya approaches, various updates about the temple are being reported by the media. However, misleading and fake news are also being published by some media houses regarding the Ram Mandir. One such false information was provided by News24, which claimed that the idol of Ram Lalla to be installed in the temple is being made by a Muslim sculptor and his son.On 14th December, News24 posted a tweet on X, claiming that Muhammad Jamaluddin from West Bengal and his son Bittu are sculpting the idol of Ram Lalla, which will take its place in the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. The tweet in Hindi said, “Ramlalla is ready to sit in the Ram temple of Ayodhya in January.” After that, the media houses added four bullet points, the first of which said, “The idols were made by Mohammad Jamaluddin of Bengal and his son Bittu.”News24 then said in the post that father-son duo has been crafting idols for a long time. The post then added remarks by Jamaluddin, who said, ‘Religion is a personal thing. People following many religions live in our country. The culture of brotherhood is my message as an artiste.’By saying that Jamaluddin and his son are making the idol of Ram Lall to be placed in Ram Mandir, News24 implied that the Muslim duo is making the main idol to placed in the sanctum sanctorum of the temple.

"14 December, 2023 ","N Ram pats his own back for a pompous, gassy editorial in The Hindu, The Wire has a monumental meltdown: Fallout of SC decision...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/n-ram-pompous-editorial-the-hindu-the-wire-meltdown-sc-decision-article-370/,"N.Ram, Siddarth Varadarajan and their ilk know very well that the Parliament can split or not split a state even when there is an elected government in place and the legislature wishes otherwise.On December 11th, the Supreme Court upheld the abolition of the dreaded Article 370 (I know it was repealed and therefore while Article 370 still exists in the Constitution, the original dreaded purpose for which it was intended doesn’t exist anymore). Certain sections of the English media; certain sections of the I.N.D.I alliance and the entire Congress party went bonkers over this decision of the Supreme Court. Watching their meltdowns gave me goosebumps, literally. Am sure that their WhatsApp groups buzzed with messages on what should be their best strategy on this topic. The line of argument they have chosen to bombard their readers/viewers is – Attack on Federalism! A long, pompous and gassy editorial was published in his newspaper, The Hindu (we will get it later in this article). N. Ram showed utmost humility and described his editorial as “clear-sighted and insightful”. A former CEO of The Hindu group of publications, Rajiv C. Lochan, dared to call out this humility of N.Ram on Twitter here (“Beware when one pats one’s own back”. He went on to comment that “the pervasive use of adjectives can’t strengthen a relatively weak set of arguments”. Rajiv Lochan was telling N. Ram that just because he used good English doesn’t mean that this editorial is insightful. Now, the unparalleled arrogance of N. Ram is well known. Occasionally he takes it upon himself to prove it yet again to all his readers. Rajiv Lochan provided the best opportunity for N. Ram to exhibit his famed arrogance and intolerance in public. True to his image, N. Ram use a lot of English words to convey a simple meaning. I would urge you to read the image below and have a hearty laugh at N. Ram’s meltdown! He is telling Rajiv Lochan that a mere CEO should shut up because there is no one better than N.Ram to have opinions in this whole world. How can a mere CEO comment in public about matters as trivial as Article 370? Imagine N. Ram’s attitude towards mere citizens if he goes bombastic like this on his former CEO! After reading the “clear-sighted and insightful” editorial about 3 to 5 times, I was able to find 2 sentences that summarized the arguments of the entire English media gang. The title of the editorial makes it sound like doomsday is near and we will die because of what the Supreme Court did! I have highlighted the relevant portion in the editorial that tells us that Parliament can now do anything while keeping a state under the President’s rule. This was what his compatriots at The Wire were also shrieking about. The meltdown at The Wire was even more monumental in proportions. Multiple opinion pieces popped up in a short time – all telling us the same thing – that there is no difference left between “democracy and dictatorship”; that there are “Serious implications” for the entire country; that this is an “attack on the basic structure of federalism”; and the best of all – Many “locals had feared” that they have been pushed into “meaningful silence”!Think about what these people are writing folks. What is wrong with “meaningful silence”? What is wrong with anything that is classified as “meaningful”? How can you use the word “meaningful” as a consequence of having “fear” to want it? N.Ram, Siddarth Varadarajan and their ilk know very well that the Parliament can split or not split a state even when there is an elected government in place and the legislature wishes otherwise. When she was the CM of UP, Mayawati passed a resolution in the UP Assembly asking the centre to split into 4 states. The then Home Minister flatly rejected the resolution. The disastrous manner in which AP was split into TS and AP is still fresh in many minds. The AP Legislature resolved that the state should not be split. Did that stop Sonia Gandhi from taking a stand otherwise? Examples galore exist on this topic. Starting from 1956 when their hero Nehru suspended the first elected communist government in the world in Kerala using a “brute majority” in Parliament. We can further discuss the language of Articles 1,2 and 3 in the Constitution of India. It wouldn’t serve any purpose for these people. We are approaching 10 years of Modi government. Despite their wonderful knowledge of the English language, these editors and owners have not been able to find new words, in the past 10 years, to describe their contempt towards the people of India for electing Modi. By rehashing the same words, and in the garb of being “insightful” and “clear-sighted”, all that these people have succeeded in was to show us how blinded they are to the reality of a new emerging Bharat. A Bharat that will embrace all meaningful decisions and leave behind all the meaningless trash these people dish out every day. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"14 December, 2023 ",‘Parliament me toh apne hi log gaye hain’: Leftist journalist Anil Sinha supports the accused in parliament security breach case,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/parliament-me-toh-apne-hi-log-gaye-hain-leftist-journalist-anil-sinha-parliament-security-breach-case/,"By calling the parliament intruders 'Apne Hi Log', Anil Sinha essentially meant that they belonged to the same ideology as him. He also lauded them for raising the same issues in the parliament which he claimed he was discussing in the debates.On Wednesday (13th December), the leftist-liberal YouTube channel Satya Hindi discussed the BJP’s landslide victory in three states and the change of generation in the leadership of the BJP in the states. During this discussion, leftist journalist Anil Sinha supported the accused in the recent episode of a security breach in the parliament wherein two youths jumped into the house from the visitor’s gallery and released a yellow gas from the canisters. Anil Sinha said, “We don’t have any IT cell to give reactions on this. Had the names of people from minority communities come up in the recent incident (of parliament security breach), they would have sat with a panel to discuss it by now. They (BJP and its supporters) would have taken a march from Vijay Chowk saying that it is an attack on constitution and democracy. But now they are sitting quietly and presenting it differently. Had Congress defeated them, why would we sit here to discuss and debate? On the Doklam issue, Vishnu Som of NDTV has reported along with satellite pictures. He showed how China has settled colonies there. He expressed doubt that China may manipulate Bhutan against us. But they are saying that Bhutan is with us only. Even the situation in Laddakh and Arunachal Pradesh is the same. There is no debate on China’s infiltration. But you see one on the parliament security breach.”Anil Sinha said, “Parliament me toh apne hi log gaye hain (Those who intruded into the parliament are our men only.) It is just that they entered the parliament in a wrong way. That is their only mistake. But they had gone there to register the protest. They did not harm anybody. Did they? And they raised the same issues (as us). And outside the parliament, they just released the gas. But, how did they reach there in the first place? Even I have covered parliament. How did they enter there crossing layers of security? This just exposes the security system of the new parliament.”That part can be heard after 52 minutes in the above video. Communist Journalists:""Parliament mei toh apne hi log gaye hain""""Kisi ko nuksaan toh pahunchaya nhi""""Protest karne gaye the na bhai"" pic.twitter.com/p4cqSji6udBy calling the parliament intruders ‘Apne Hi Log’, Anil Sinha essentially meant that they belonged to the same ideology as him. He also lauded them for raising the same issues in the parliament which he claimed he was discussing in the debates.On the 22nd anniversary of the 2001 Parliament terror attack, a major security breach occurred when two intruders entered the Lok Sabha chamber from the visitor gallery during Zero Hour. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) ordered an inquiry into a Parliament security breach incident. Six accused have been arrested in this case so far. On Thursday, police sources said that the main conspirator in Wednesday’s Parliament security breach is someone else, as per the initial investigation. The accused had conducted a recce outside the parliament beforehand. Police sources mentioned that all accused were associated with a social media page ‘Bhagat Singh Fan Club.’ Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Copy-paste journalism, reliance on lunatic who wanted Mamata Banerjee raped, claims about ‘SkinDoctor’",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/washington-post-disinfo-lab-article-on-pakistani-conspiracy-theory/,"Despite his questionable character and dwindling credibility, Aveek Sen's misleading tweets on 'Disinfo Lab' became the primary fodder for both 'Pakistani Defence' and 'The Washington Post'.A day after The Washington Post carried out a hit job on Indian OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) handle ‘Disinfo Lab’, it has come to light that some of the outlandish claims made by the American newspaper bear an uncanny resemblance to conspiracy theories peddled by a Pakistani website.In an attempt to de-legitimise ‘Disinfo Lab’, The Washington Post claimed on Sunday (10th December) that the OSINT handle is run by an Indian Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) officer named Lt. Col. Dibya Satpathy.Although it relied on word salad, insinuations, ‘source-based’ allegations and dubious ‘experts’, the American newspaper failed to provide any empirical evidence that could dispute any claims of ‘Disinfo Lab.’Interestingly, a large part of the purported ‘investigation’ by The Washington Post on the Indian OSINT handle appears to be based on conspiracy theories peddled by a website named ‘Pakistan Defence.’In an article titled ‘Disinfo Lab – A Disinformation Project of Indian RA&W’, published by the website in February 2022, a staff writer Amaa’n relied on outlandish claims made by ‘journalist’ Aveek Sen to draw links between ‘Disinfo Lab’ and Indian Intelligence.The ‘Pakistan Defence’ article made references to Lt. Colonel Dibya Satpathy, Ajayendra Tripathi, and BJP leader Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga – all of whom appear prominently in the propaganda piece of The Washington Post.The Pakistani website presented the accusations of Aveek Sen, an abusive troll, as the ‘gospel truth.’ In the tweet from 2013 that went viral, Aveek Sen was seen quoting TimesNow, saying that Mamata Banerjee had called the Barasat rapists ‘CPIM supporters’. To that, Aveek Sen had responded saying “Its high time these cpm supporters rape Mamata!”Prior to deleting his account, Aveek Sen had made several dergatory comments targeting women. A few of his archived misogynist tweets can be seen here – In several of his tweets, Aveek Sen was seen referring to women as ‘prostitutes.’Despite his questionable character and dwindling credibility, Sen’s misleading tweets on ‘Disinfo Lab’ became the primary fodder for both ‘Pakistani Defence’ and ‘The Washington Post’. Interestingly, he had also collaborated with the likes of propaganda outlets such as Newslaundry.“And the making of Indian fake disinfo lab, copying the famous eu disinfo lab that exposed hundreds and thousands of fake Indian websites (By author Aveek sen),” read a line from the article on ‘Pakistan Defence.’Coincidentally, a similar language is used in the report published by The Washington Post. “Another person, a former employee, said the Disinfo Lab named and modelled itself after groups such as the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab and the EU DisinfoLab, a Brussels-based nonprofit that researches disinformation targeting Europe,” it claimed.It claimed, “Some of the fronts, setup by Colonel Dibya Satpathy, per Aveek Sen’s revelation, include: Root N Wings Media, situated at B-3, Bali’s, Near BSES Office, Arya Samaj Mandir, Lajpat Nagar 2, Delhi. Flat A-20, Lajpat Nagar 3, near Ring Road, Delhi.”Interestingly, the claims made it to the report of The Washington Post as well. “The Disinfo Lab, which at one point consisted of about a dozen private contractors working out of a four-story whitewashed building on a leafy street in New Delhi,” the leftist newspaper wrote.In another paragraph, it said, “The office operated under the name Root and Wings Media.” Based on Aveek Sen’s tweets, the shady Pakistani website alleged that Lt. Colonel Dibya Satpathy had been campaigning against the country on the behest of R&AW and BJP.OpIndia found yet another uncanny resemblance in the report of The Washington Post where it said, “The Disinfo Lab itself was headed by Satpathy, whose work has focused mostly on countering Pakistan.”“The Disinfo Lab’s activities show how the online propaganda campaigns waged by the BJP and its allies have been expanding beyond their traditional, domestic aims of shoring up popular support and denigrating opposition parties — and now seek to influence attitudes far beyond India’s borders,” the American newspaper claimed in another part of the article.Both The Washington Post and ‘Pakistan Defence’ made specific references to ‘Root Wings Media’ and characterised it as a ‘social media marketing company/ campaign agency.’“The company has no more than ten employees, typical of an intelligence front,” the Pakistani website said. And this is what the American newspaper claimed – “The Disinfo Lab, which at one point consisted of about a dozen private contractors.” Both The Washingon Post and ‘Pakistan Defence’ targeted targeted the ‘Disinfo Lab’ for exposing the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) and its biased reporting on India, which is often used to cast aspersions on Indian democracy.“Some of the investigative reports published by this website include one aiming to discredit the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom,” wrote ‘Pakistan Defence.’“The Disinfo Lab often cites publicly available U.S. lobbying and campaign finance records and produces complex flowcharts to illustrate alleged relationships. But the group draws tenuous connections, claiming, for instance, that a USCIRF commissioner was influenced by Islamists because she once worked on a conservative fundraising committee alongside a lobbyist who went on to represent Muslim American groups,” claimed The Washington Post.In February this year, OpIndia reported in detail about the ties of former USCIRF Commissioner Anurima Bhargava to far-left billionaire George Soros. We also exposed how the controversial body has relied on the dubious ‘Tek Fog’ story to make insinuations about India.The Washington Post ensured to not include all conspiracy theories to set its ‘investigative article’ apart from that of ‘Pakistan Defence.’ The Pakistani website had even dubbed popular member and dermatologist Neelam Singh aka ‘The Skin Doctor’ as an aide to R&AW officer Lt. Colonel Dibya Satpathy.“The Evil nexus of Col Dibya Satpathy Indian ex-military intelligence officer and bjp troll farms. To (sic) manufacture and spread propaganda and misinformation with the help of Major Neelam “Neel” Kumari alias “The Skin Doctor”, Major Gaurav Arya,” it claimed.‘Pakistan Defence’ accused ‘The Skin Doctor’ of carrying out the ‘evil nexus’ of supposed ‘Disinfo Lab’ founder and Indian Intelligence officerThe Washington Post did not copy-paste the outrageous claims about ‘Disinfo Lab’ only from ‘Pakistan Defence’ but another Pakistani-based website named ‘Centre for Strategic and Contemporary Research (CSCR).Interestingly, CSCR published another misleading piece on ‘Disinfo Lab’ a year before that of ‘Pakistan Defence.’ Habitual fake news peddler and anti-Hindu activist CJ Werleman had made similar insinuations about the Indian OSINT handle in February last year.First, the claim of our association with Govt agencies/ RAW. The report is essentially a recycle of previous reports published by Pakistani ISPR/ Info-war machinery. The report is periodically recycled, last by known fake news peddler CJ Werleman.Lazy Journalism!(2/n) pic.twitter.com/0oXNGfrVyoIn November 2021, CJ Werleman had appealed to boycott Indian products to supposedly ‘save’ Muslims in India and Kashmir. Before that, he had tweeted a video of Pramod Muthalik, the chief of the Hindu activist group Shri Rama Sene, to allege that he called for violence against Muslims and the demolition of a mosque in Karnataka. Earlier, he claimed Indians had destroyed a Muslim graveyard in Himachal Pradesh, which was also fake news. In August 2021 when the Islamist group Taliban took over Afghanistan, Werleman was caught spreading Taliban propaganda. In September 2021, he called for ‘regime decapitation’ strikes against India.The Print, run by Shekhar Gupta had eulogised Werleman in a profile describing him as a ‘bigot-turned-crusader against ‘Islamophobia’ who is taking on the Indian state’. Since every anti-India propagandist is a potential source of The Washington Post, there will surely be no dearth of more anti-India hit pieces ahead of the 2024 elections.While hitting out at The Washington Post, ‘Disinfo Lab’ pointed out that the only difference in its article and past hitjobs against it is the addition of unnamed sources. “The only ‘upgrade’ the WaPo did was to make this Pakistani allegation ‘anonymous’. And whatever is in addition to that is again attributed to ‘anonymous’ sources. Hence, literally, every fact claimed is ‘anonymous’. The report has more than 10 anonymous sources,” it added.As pointed out earlier by OpIndia, The Washington Post failed to refute any assertions made by ‘Disinfo Lab.’ It also noted, “While, in their questions to us and other people, WaPo journalists have themselves noted that our claims are factually correct! (thanks for acknowledgement), they alleged that we make ‘tenuous claims’, and cited a few examples.”While calling out the bluff of the leftist newspaper, Disinfo Lab concluded that The Washington Post is overrated. “It is not surprising that people who don’t understand OSINT are baffled by our reporting. It is especially hard for legacy media journos – Indian and foreign alike, who have known journalism only as handouts from sources. Agencies are overrated. OSINT is underrated,” it emphasised.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

Musk wrote, “I’m literally rofl rn.” Indian American businessman and GOP Presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy faced an embarrassing moment when he forgot to mute his mic while taking a ‘loo break’ from an active X (Twitter) space. Around 2.3 million listeners were tuned in when Ramaswamy encountered the hot mic moment. On the X (Twitter) Space, Ramaswamy was participating in a discussion on the future of technology. During the session, Elon Musk was explaining the rationale behind reinstating the banned X account of Alex Jones, founder of the website Infowars, back on his micro-blogging platform.

But I am not able to mute you.” On returning from the short break, Vivek Ramaswamy realised that his mic was unmuted and understood what had transpired. He immediately apologised for the embarrassing moment. However, on a lighter note, Musk quips, “I hope you feel better now”. To which Ramaswamy replied, “I feel great.

"8 December, 2023 ",High priest to lead the consecration ceremony of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya is a descendant of priest who presided over the coronation of Chhatrapati...,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/know-the-shivaji-connection-of-priest-who-will-lead-ram-temple-consecration/,"More than 40 scholars from Kashi and 121 from all branches of the Vedas throughout India are scheduled to be guided by him during the solemn idol consecration ceremonies from January 16 to January 22. 86-year-old Vedic scholar Laxmikant Mathuranath Dixit is expected to preside over the consecration ritual of the Ram Lalla idol at the Ram temple in Ayodhya on 22 January, marking a landmark confluence of heritage and modern relevance. He is a Varanasi native and reportedly descended from the distinguished Kashi scholar Gaga Bhatt of the 17th century who headed the coronation of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj around 350 years ago in 1674, which was a momentous occasion in Indian history that represented the creation of Hindavi Swarajya, an autonomous Maratha state.More than 40 scholars from Kashi and 121 from all branches of the Vedas throughout India are scheduled to be guided by him during the solemn idol consecration ceremonies from January 16 to January 22. The learned man responded, “It is because of the blessings bestowed on me by the legendary saints and seers of Kashi that I have been assigned the responsibility of supervising the consecration of Ram Lalla. I will perform my duties with the blessings of Lord Ram,” in an interview.The scholar’s son, Sunil Laxmikant Dixit stated that his father’s areas of expertise included yajna, consecration, Srauta which is a Sanskrit word rooted in Sruti or that which is heard and Smarta which is based on Smriti, a particular collection of Hindu literature among other rites and rituals. “My father’s study of the Vedas and rituals was under the supervision of his uncle Ganesh Dixit Javji Bhatt. He completed his studies in Shukla Yajurveda at Sangved Vidyalaya and took up teaching in the same institution. Mathuranath Dixit proclaimed, “Our roots are in Jeur village near Solapur in Maharashtra. Our ancestors moved to Kashi and dedicated their lives to the study of Hindu traditions and rituals.” Laxmikant Mathuranath Dixit and other priests are conducting a series of religious ceremonies as part of the meticulous preparation of the consecration procedures which are scheduled to begin on 16 January. These customs which culminate on 22 January when Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to carry out the rites commemorating the consecration of the Ram Lalla idol include Sarva Prayashchit homam, Dashvid Snan, Jalyatra, Tirth and Kalash Pujan as well as Kalash Yatra.Three idols of Ram Lalla are being made in Ayodhya, and the religious committee of the temple trust is tasked with picking the finest among them. The idols of Lord Ram are believed to be almost finished and are 90% concluded. The idols depict the diety’s child form. One idol is made with stone from Rajasthan and two are made from stones brought from Karnataka, the finishing touches will require around a week. Earlier, a stone was brought from Nepal, and later stones were also brought from Odisha and Maharashtra to carve the idol, but those were found not suitable. The sanctum sanctorum and the temple’s ground floor are already in a highly developed state of preparedness. Among the several ceremonies leading up to the consecration, one of the main ones on 21 January is the immersion of the idol of Ram Lalla in water from sacred rivers and well-known Hindu pilgrimage destinations which is collected in 114 urns. On 22 January in the afternoon, there will be Devpranpratishtha (consecration) rites. The idol will be brought from 8 a.m. to noon to the sanctum sanctorum. Pran-Pratishtha of Ram Lalla will be observed on 16 January and the principal rituals will be performed on 22 January by Lakshmikant Dixit.After visiting the Vice President of Vishva Hindu Parishad Champat Rai in September, the Kanchi Kamakoti Shankaracharya despatched a team of scholars, including Laxmikant Mathuranath Dixit and Acharya Ganesh Shastri Dravid to Ayodhya to determine the dates of consecration.Notable individuals who have been invited to the consecration ceremony of the Ram temple include actors Arun Govil and Dipika Chikhlia who played Lord Ram and Goddess Sita in the hit TV series ‘Ramayana,’ industrialists Mukesh Ambani, Gautam Adani and Ratan Tata, cricketers Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli, Bollywood megastar Amitabh Bachchan among other actors.Over 7,000 guests comprising 3,000 VIPs have received invites from the Ram Mandir Trust. There will also be an invitation sent to the families of the karsevaks who lost their lives in the temple movement. Further invitees consist of 4,000 seers, writers, journalists, scientists, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) president Mohan Bhagwat, yoga guru Ramdev and esteemed figures from all around the nation.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"15 December, 2023 ","Who is Shahrukh Pathan’s father: Convicted for 10 years over drug peddling, evidence of collusion with Pakistanis and more",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/who-is-shahrukh-pathan-father-convicted-10-years-drug-peddling-collusion-pakistani-delhi-riots/,"The bail order made several revelations about Shahrukh Patha, the case and the remorseless conduct of Pathan after he was arrested, based on the evidence provided by the prosecution which were accepted by the court. Shahrukh Pathan, who pointed a gun at a policeman during the anti-Hindu riots in North-East Delhi in 2020, was refused regular bail by a Delhi court on 14th December. The court stated it observed no need to grant him bail and Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat of Karkardooma Court noted, “Considering the conduct of the accused Shahrukh Pathan in jail during his judicial custody, his conduct prior to his being arrested, conduct during court proceedings and most importantly, the allegations against the accused which are being supported by the eyewitnesses and also the video footage, on any of the counts on which bail can be considered, the court sees nothing to set him enlarged on bail.”The bail order made several revelations about Shahrukh Patha,n the case and the remorseless conduct of Pathan after he was arrested, based on the evidence provided by the prosecution which was accepted by the court. The case pertains to the infamous picture where Shahrukh Pathan was seen holding a gun to a police officer’s head during the Delhi anti-hindu riots. During the riot, on the 24th of February 2020, a confrontation broke out between Jaffrabad Metro Station and Maujpur Bridge. There were more than 5,000 people who came face to face in that area. The anti-CAA protestors (Islamist mob) were pelting stones and brandishing guns. When the investigation was carried out, 3 cartridges were found at the spot where Shahrukh Pathan brandished a gun, aimed at the head of a police officer in uniform. The order details how Shahrukh Pathan first fired a few rounds at the crowd and refused to pay heed to the warnings issued by the police officer. When he advanced, for the safety of the crowd, the police officer stood in his path and did not move. When Pathan was at a distance of 9-10 feet from the police officer, he fired his weapon aimed at the police officer’s head to kill him. The police officer dodged the bullet but continued to stand there in his path so he couldn’t advance further and kill the Hindus. As the police officer refused to move, Pathan pushed the officer and then aimed the gun at his head again. When the police officer issued another warning after being pushed, Shahrukh Pathan fired at the crowd and started retreating. It was only after sustained interrogation that Shahrukh Pathan revealed his full identity and confessed to his involvement in the crime. The prosecution has also argued that Shahrukh Pathan was not only attempting to kill the police officer but was also leading the mob. Interestingly, the order reveals how Shahrukh Pathan was not cooperative during the investigation and refused to reveal the identity of other rioters who were involved. During the investigation, it is detailed, that Pathan also tried his best to mislead the police. He has also displayed aggressive and remorseless conduct in jail. The prosecution argued that if let out on bail, he could potentially influence witnesses and tamper with evidence. Also, given the fear of the 10-year jail term that could be handed to him, he could abscond. Taking into account his conduct inside the jail and during the investigation, the court agreed with the prosecution and refused to grant him bail. In the order document detailing the arguments of the prosecution, there was one specific argument that deserved further investigation. The prosecution had argued that Shahrukh Pathan’s father, Sabir Ali (alias Baldev Singh) was convicted for 10 years with a fine of Rs 1 lac under Section 14 of the Foreigners Act and sections of the NDPS Act. OpIndia pulled up the court judgement in the case where Shahrukh Pathan’s father was convicted by a Delhi court. The judgement convicting him was pronounced on 11th August 2016. The facts of the case, detailed in the court order, almost read like a movie. In January 2010, Meghalaya Police filed a complaint in Delhi that three Pakistani nationals Abdul Razzaq, Mohd. Saddique and Rafakat Ali who had been brought from Lampur Seva Sadan (FRRO detention centre) on 1st January 2010 to Guru Nanak Eye Hospital for their medical examination had escaped while they were being taken back. During the investigation to track down the missing Pakistanis, the visitor’s register which was maintained by Meghalaya Police was also checked. The entries in the register made from 28/9/2009 to 02/01/2010 revealed that two people – Anees Khan and Arbaz Khan – had met Abdul Razzaq and Saleem on 29/12/2009 and 30/12/2009. During interrogation, it was revealed that before absconding on 1/1/2010, the three Pakistanis had after going to Gurunanak Eye Hospital were first taken to Jama Masjid and then one of them (Abdul Razzak) was taken by him to Seelampur near Jaffarbad to collect money from someone. Anees and Arbaz were nephews of Sabir Ali. It is pertinent to understand here that the three Pakistanis were in India illegally and therefore, were being held at a detention centre. From the story so far, it is also clear that they were given harbour at Jama Masjid from where one of them was taken to Seelampur (near Jaffrabad) to collect money – the very area where the Delhi anti-Hindu riots had broken out in February 2020 – in which Shahrukh Pathan was also leading a mob. Based on this investigation, Sabir Ali (Baldev Singh), Anees Khan and Arbaz were called to the Special Cell office and inquiries were made from them. During interrogation, it was revealed that it was Sabir Ali (Baldev Singh) who had given money to Abdul Razzaq at Seelampur before he had absconded. Essentially, from the records so far, it is clear that it was Shahrukh Pathan’s father who had give money to a Pakistani before they had absconded. This money was give to the illegal in Seelampur. The numbers that were taken from the accused during interrogation were then thoroughly investigated after those detained and questioned – including the father of Shahrukh Pathan – were set free. During the surveillance of the numbers, it was revealed that the accused – including Pathan’s father – were involved in the business of fake currency and drugs. There was also an intercepted call where Sabir Ali had spoken about the international smuggling of drugs. After this surveillance, when a notice was served to Sabir Ali, Arbaz and Anees, they refused to answer the notice served by the special cell. The Special Cell then received information about a Charas and Smack delivery that Sabir Ali and his co-accused Sannaullah Mir were about to make. When the raiding party intercepted Ali and Mir, they discovered drugs in their possession. Substantial amounts of drugs were also found on the scooter of Sabir Ali – the substance in the scooter was heroin. After the subsequent arrest, Mir and Ali were interrogated separately. During interrogation, the father of Shahrukh Pathan, Sabir Ali, confessed that he was in the business of drugs and fake currency notes along with his associates Anees, Arbaz, Jarnail and Mir. He also disclosed how the police could arrest Jarnail Singh and revealed that on an earlier occasion, Singh had given him 2 lacs and drugs, parts of which were then distributed to the others. He also agreed to lead the police to another accused – Javed. Several of the co-accused were then arrested post-interrogation of Ali. In 2011, all the accused persons were charged for the offences u/s 29 r.w.s. 21, 20 and 23 of the NDPS Act and accused Sabir Ali was separately charged for the offence u/s 21(c), 25A of the NDPS Act and accused Sanaullah Mir was separately charged for the offence of u/s 20 (b) (ii) (C) of the NDPS Act. All the accused persons were also charged for the offences u/s 489 C r.w.s. 120B IPC.In court, the prosecution examined 39 witnesses in all to prove its case against the accused. All the accused, including the father of Shahrukh Pathan, took the defence that they had been falsely implicated by the police and that no contraband/counterfeit currency notes had been recovered from their possession or at their instance at any point in time. Among all the accused, the court ‘particularly’ was intrigued by the defence of Sabir Ali alias Baldev Singh. It is pertinent to mention here that Shahrukh Pathan’s father was previously a Sikh named Baldev Singh and had converted to Islam before marrying. When Sabir Ali started explaining why he was supposedly implicated by the police, he ended up revealing his long illustrious career as a criminal. Here is what the court document said: “In particular accused Baldev Singh has stated that he originally belongs to Punjab and shifted to Delhi in 1984 due to political turmoil and terrorist activities in Punjab. In Delhi he started selling garments from a patri in Chandni Chowk but in the year 1984 the police officials of Maurice Nagar falsely arrested him on a mere suspicion that he was a terrorist. When their enquiry into his antecedents did not reveal anything incriminating against him, they planted contraband on him and falsely implicated him in a case under the Excise Act. After spending three years in the jail in the said case, he came out and started working as a driver for a transport company. During the said services a vehicle which he was driving was intercepted by DRI and contraband was recovered from the same. Though he had no knowledge and had nothing to do with the contraband concealed in the said vehicle, he was arrested by DRI and also subsequently convicted in the said case and again spent more than 10 years in judicial custody. After coming out from the jail after undergoing the sentence in the said case he again started his life afresh and started doing the business of pannis/plastics and started living with his children, his wife, his brother in law, Anees and Arbaz, the son of his second brother in law Babu Khan, in his house H.No. U­108, Gali no. 5, Arvind Nagar, Gautam Vihar, Gonda. He suspects that somebody in his locality informed the local police officials about his previous records and that is why the officials of Special Cell came to his residence in the first week of January, 2010 and forcibly picked him, his son and Anees and Arbaz and took them to PS and started inquiring about same Pakistani nationals who had absconded. Though they were released from the PS after the police officials found nothing incriminating against them, on 3/9/2010 again he, Anees and Arbaz were forcibly picked up from their residence at 1:30 a.m. in the night and brought to the office of Special cell, Rohini and falsely implicated in this case”. Essentially, Shahrukh Pathan’s father at the time had asserted that he was being falsely implicated by the police in this case of collusion with Pakistanis and being involved in an international drug peddling and fake currency racket because he had done exactly that in the past, been convicted for it, and therefore, the police thought of him as a convenient target. Further, he also dared to claim that all the previous times he was caught with contrabands and convicted, even then, he was falsely implicated. The shoddy defence that was put up by Sabir Ali was backed only by one witness – the witness’ only testimony was that he had never seen a Pakistani enter the home of Ali. This statement was made without any evidence. The court said, “The testimony of the prosecution witnesses is trustworthy and believable and nothing has emerged in their cross­examination which cast doubt on the veracity of their statement or to impeach their creditworthiness”. The court also said that all the seizure of drugs and fake currency was done per the law. While the defence tried to puncture technical holes in the process, the court threw out all of their arguments and convicted the accused – including Sabir Ali. To that effect, the court said, “as far as recovery of contraband from accused Baldev Singh and Sanaullah is concerned, in my view, the prosecution has been able to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt”. While the court rejected the argument that the accused were colluding with each other, it convicted all accused for the possession of contraband substances, however, there was amply evidence of collusion as well based on the statements of Ali. Based on this evidence, Sabir Ali, the father of Shahrukh Pathan, was sentenced to 10 years in prison and 1 lac fine in 2016. According to reports, Shahrukh’s mother also is said to be a notorious drug peddler.In his show ‘Prime Time’ on 26th February 2020, Ravish Kumar resorted to spreading half-truths and full lies about the horrifying spate of violence that had engulfed the national capital. In pursuance of what appeared as his agenda to tarnish Hindus and portray them as the aggressors of the riots, Kumar identified Mohammad Shahrukh alias Shahrukh Pathan, who fired at Delhi Police personnel on February 24, as one ‘Anurag Mishra’. For the 26th February show, Ravish claimed that police had not yet arrested him while he was arrested on 25th February itself, good 24 hours before his show premiered. “Police ki haalat yeh hai ki abhi tak giraftar nahin hua hai. Police saaf kehti hai ki Shahrukh hai magar aap social media mein dekhiye Anurag Mishra bataya jaa raha hai. (Situation of the Police is such that they have not yet arrested him. Police says his name is Shahrukh but if you see on social media, he is called Anurag Mishra),” he spoke in his characteristic drawl during the show. Naturally, it was quite a revelation since no one had yet referred to the shooter as “Anurag Mishra” till then.He then asked Delhi Police to speak out on his identity again. He then played an undated speech of his reporter who appeared to be asking Delhi Police personnel about Shahrukh’s arrest. Slyly, Ravish Kumar then played the videos of BJP leaders Anurag Thakur, Kapil Mishra and Pravesh Verma addressing rallies ahead of Delhi elections to cast aspersions that their speeches were responsible for stoking riots a month later. Further, in August 2021, 18 months after the 25-year-old Delhi anti-Hindu riots accused Shahrukh Pathan was arrested for brandishing a gun at the police and threatening them, The Quint published a white paper on him watering down his crime and making him appear like a cherubic saint. The Quint started by describing his menacing march as ‘brazen confidence in his gait’. Then the writer of the ‘Shahrukh Pathan fan page’ romanticised his criminal act. “Unfazed by the policemen in riot gear, he shot bullets in the air while media persons captured his acts in astonishment. The fact that the gym enthusiast, who was also a local, did not wear a mask to hide his identity, made his ‘bravado’ seem peculiar and odd,” the author wrote. The Quint then went on to explain how his friends described Shahrukh as someone who was into grooming and was interested in his appearance. He was characterised as someone who was a biryani-lover, liked to put gel in his hair, blow dry it, wear crisp, ironed shirts, good shoes and well, make TikTok videos. The author interviewed Pathan’s mother, who had glowing views about her son. She said her son was innocent and ‘simple-minded’.Shahrukh’s mother also highlighted counterfactual scenarios to water down her son’s criminality. She told his fans at The Quint that she often wonders, “What if she had given him food when he asked? What if the timing was a few minutes before or after namaz?” Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

"15 December, 2023 ","‘They came in a vehicle with no number plates, set fire on Bittu Bajrangi’s brother’: Arman had earlier burned his own shop to blame...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/bittu-bajrangis-brother-set-on-fire-arman-had-earlier-burned-his-own-shop-to-blame-hindus-says-activist/,"Bittu Bajrangi said that during the Nuh riots, Armaan used to sell juice in Faridabad. He had set his own shop on fire and had tried to blame local Hindus for it. However, his lie was caught during the police investigation.On Wednesday (December 13th) Hindu activist Bittu Bajrangi’s family was targeted and attackers attempted to burn his brother Mahesh Panchal alive by pouring thinner on him in the Dabua Colony in Haryana’s Faridabad. Within hours, victim Mahesh Panchal was transferred from three hospitals while in a critical condition. Mahesh has sustained severe burn injuries, estimated to be around 60%, and he is in critical condition. The next 72 hours, according to the doctors, will be crucial for the victim.As per the information received, the assailants who burned Mahesh first attempted to capture and burn him, but they were unsuccessful. Subsequently, they poured thinner on Mahesh and set him ablaze. Following this, the accused escaped. Mahesh dived into a drain right away, but the fire was not extinguished. He then took 3-4 dips, and the fire was quenched. After that, he walked to his house, which was around 800 metres away on his own as nobody came forward to help him. When finally Mahesh somehow reached his home, Bittu Bajrangi took him the the hospital. According to media reports, the attackers led by one Armaan first confirmed Bittu Bajrangi’s brother Mahesh Panchal’s identity. ‘Are you the brother of Bittu Bajrangi?’ they questioned Mahesh Panchal. When Mahesh said yes to this question, they poured thinner on him and set him ablaze.Arman Khan, the main accused in this case, has been arrested by police and is being interrogated. Meanwhile, the police have examined the crime scene. According to the report, the white WagonR used by the attackers had no registration number. Moreover, two bikes had followed him suspiciously to the location.Meanwhile, Bittu Bajrangi stated that Mahesh has been moved around three hospitals so far. First, it was the government hospital, then it was Santosh Hospital, and now it is Prachi Hospital. The doctors have said that the next 72 hours will be critical. Several members of Hindu organisations and local BJP MLAs visited the hospital to inquire about Mahesh’s well-being.Bittu Bajrangi said that during the Nuh riots, Armaan used to sell juice in Faridabad. He had set his own shop on fire and had tried to blame local Hindus for it. However, his lie was caught during the police investigation.Bittu Bajrangi further stated that he had been receiving death threats for a long with those behind the threats asking him to “take his slippers back (Chappal lekar jao)”. The code ‘chappal’ was used by the perpetrators to remind Bajrangi about the slippers Hindus had left outside the temple when the Islamist mob attacked them during Nuh violence earlier this year.Bittu alleged that the attackers who attempted to kill his brother were all involved in the July 31 violence unleashed by Islamists in Haryana’s Nuh district. Bittu Bajrangi stated that the family sought an arms licence, but the administration refused. Not only that, but Bittu said, citing a police officer, that the person who issued the threats had also threatened a prominent Gurgaon businessman for ‘protection money’ adding that he is a seasoned criminal.Meanwhile, an OpIndia team arrived on the scene and found several police personnel stationed at the hospital. Several members of Hindu organisations also convened at the hospital. However, no one is permitted to meet with the victim. The police have imposed multiple sections in this case, including sections 147, 149, 307, and 326A. Arman, the accused, is being questioned by local police.Bittu Bajrangi told OpIndia that he is satisfied with the actions taken by the Faridabad Police in the matter so far. He has also urged people to refrain from engaging in any form of protest or unlawful activity.Bittu Bajrangi is a Hindu activist who raises his voice for the unity of Hindus. After the violence that erupted in Nuh in the Mewat region, his name gained more traction in the news. Subsequently, he was also arrested in a case of a clash with the police. At present, Bittu Bajrangi is out of jail on bail. In this case, all Hindu organisations supported him. Initially, the rumour spread rapidly that Bittu Bajrangi was associated with the Nuh violence, but the police made it clear that action was taken against Bittu Bajrangi not related to the Nuh violence, but in a different case of a clash with the police.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"15 December, 2023 ","Pune: Govt land in Kondhwa’s Hindu locality allotted for playground being converted into Muslim ‘Qabristan’, residents complain. Here’s all you need to know",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/pune-govt-land-kondhwa-hindu-locality-playground-converted-into-muslim-qabristan/,"The letter submitted by the societies around survey no 44 amenity space states that there are around 12000-15000 Hindu families residing in the locality and hardly any Muslim people stay in the societies. ""There are also several temples in the area and converting the space into a Muslim burial ground might harm our religious sentiments,"" the letter reads. In a shocking case that has come to the fore from the Kondhwa region of Maharashtra’s Pune district, government land that had been earlier allotted for the construction of a playground is now being converted into a Muslim burial ground. This is after the former NCP MLA Chetan Tupe and BJP’s Yogesh Tilekar submitted a letter to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) suggesting that the amenity space around some of the Hindu societies in Kondhwa could be the perfect location to build a burial ground (Qabristan) for the Muslim community.BJP’s Yogesh Tilekar later backtracked from the suggestion, reportedly after realising the problems of the locals and after he was informed about the issues in the area.  The letter claimed that the Kondhwa region in Pune has a large Muslim population and that it would be favorable for the community to have a burial ground nearby. Former Hadapsar @NCPspeaks MLA Chetan Tupe @ChetanVTupe n @BJP4Maharashtra leader Yogesh Tilekar @iYogeshTilekar recommended converting a Hindu-majority residential area's of #Kondhwa playground into a Muslim burial ground. Pune Municipal Corporation @PMCPune has spent 46 lakh… pic.twitter.com/AKS6vc0FfaSeveral Hindu societies around the said amenity space (survey no. 44) have complained to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) objecting to the construction of a burial ground for the Muslim community. “The societies around the plot are Hindu societies and several thousand Hindu families reside in this location. Several Hindu temples are also located in the area and building a burial ground for the Muslim community here might cause religious harm to the residents,” the letter by Raviraj Colorado Co-op Housing Society read. The complaint dated 23rd October has been exclusively obtained by OpIndia upon which no action has been taken by the PMC yet. Similar complaint letters have been submitted by Achalnagar Sahakari Gruharachana Society Ltd and Shree Vardhaman Nagar Co-op Housing Society Ltd to the PMC highlighting that around 12000 to 15000 Hindu families reside in the locality and that it would be wrong to allow amenity space that was supposed to be a playground for a Muslim burial ground. The complaint letters obtained by OpIndia have been signed by all the society members who are Hindus. Amenity space is a portion of a building that adds convenience for all occupants of a building and that is not used exclusively by any one occupant. In the current case, the amenity space is just a wall close to societies that have registered complaints and the space is authoritatively looked after by the PMC. The controversy has been long-standing since the year 2021 when NCP MLA Chetan Tupe Patil submitted a letter to the PMC suggesting that the amenity space on survey no. 44 plot should be made a Muslim burial ground given that the Kondhwa region in Pune houses a large Muslim population. However, in between these years, it was later advised by the PMC’s Amenity Space Committee that a Muslim burial ground would be constructed in the amenity space on surveys no. 18 and 19 and that a playground would be constructed on survey no. 44 space. The Muslim community members then happened to press that a burial ground on survey no. 44 space would be better given the closer distance and that the supposed burial ground in Survey no 18 and 19 space would cause commuting problems for the community. Several letters to PMC pressing their demand for survey no 44 space were sent by the Nagarsevak, Adv Abdul Gafar Pathan, Parveen Haji Firoz Sheikh, and former NCP MLA Chetan Tupe Patil. The letters erroneously claimed that most of the population residing around the survey no. 44 plots were Muslims and it would be a feasible space for Muslim burial ground. A similar letter advocating for a Qabristan on survey no. 44 land was submitted by the BJP’s Yogesh Tilekar on 8th May 2023 to the PMC. The letter stated that survey no. 18 and 19 spaces were too far from the Muslim locality residing in Kondhwa and that making a burial ground on survey no. 44 space would be feasible instead. The PMC on 16th May then approved the proposal based on the letter submitted by Tilekar. However, it has come to the fore that Tilekar submitted the letter after the local Muslim community members sought his help regarding the land issue. The Muslim community representatives informed Tilekar that a maximum of the Muslim population resides around survey no. 44 amenity space and that it should be converted into a Muslim burial ground. OpIndia talked to BJP MLA Yogesh Tilekar confirming the incident. He exclusively informed OpIndia that he was misinformed about the survey no. 44 spaces and the ongoing project of playground construction on the land. “I didn’t know the land was already allotted by the PMC for a playground construction. Neither did the local Muslim representatives tell me nor the PMC. The letter I sent in May 2023 pressed for a burial ground on survey no. 44 space. However, after I learned that the maximum of population residing around the survey no. 44 space is Hindu, I sent another letter demanding the cancellation of the allotment of the land for a Muslim burial ground,” Tilekar said while talking to OpIndia. The letter of cancellation that Tilekar sent to the PMC on 23rd October 2023 clearly states that the survey no. 44 amenity space is located in a crowded area and most of the population that resides in the societies around the space is Hindu. “I first thought that the area housed a large Muslim population but I was misinformed. Most of the population residing in the locality is Hindu,” the letter reads. The entire incident was exposed after an RTI activist Dr Paritosh Zaware Patil residing in the Raviraj Colorado Co-op Housing Society (next to survey no 44 amenity space) filed an RTI demanding details of the location. It came to the fore that the PMC had already allotted the land for the construction of a playground and that the government had already spent Rs 43 lakhs for construction. Surprisingly, the land still is vacant and is under controversy over the Muslim burial ground construction. The land was allotted for the construction of the playground in the year 2017 and in 2019 grant of Rs 43 lakhs for the purpose was also obtained. The project of construction of the playground was given to some Salim Construction in the year 2019 and Rs 49 lakhs had been spent for the purpose. “The land is still vacant and no playground has been constructed here. Instead, they want to make a Muslim burial ground here. This is a crowded locality and we don’t want our children to see anything that would not be good for their age,” Dr Patil confirmed. Dr. Paristosh Patil while talking to OpIndia confirmed that survey no 18 and 19 are in the East part of the Kondhwa region and that it still stands vacant. “Some people had demanded that a vegetable market should be developed there. However, in the Amenity space committee meeting, the PMC denied the permission. That land can easily be converted into a Muslim burial ground. No problem at all. But the Muslim community members want survey no 44 amenity space only which is located in the crowded Hindu locality. They say that it is a closer option for them.” Patil added that he or the other society members have nothing to do with the community. “We are not against the Muslim community. Our problem is the burial ground. How can it be constructed in a densely crowded residential locality? All our society’s flat doors face the ground and families stay with us. What if our children ask tomorrow about the burials? Like what it is and why does this happen? Many children residing in the society are too young to see this. Even if there was a demand for Hindu cremation ground, we would have opposed it,” he added. The letter submitted by the societies around survey no 44 amenity space states that there are around 12000-15000 Hindu families residing in the locality and hardly any Muslim people stay in the societies. “There are also several temples in the area and converting the space into a Muslim burial ground might harm our religious sentiments,” the letter reads. The complaint also says that constructing a Muslim burial ground might create health hazards. “Water used for the process might seep into the society pipes causing health hazards. The societies and the survey no 44 amenity space are just a wall away from each other,” Dr Patil confirmed. Team OpIndia also talked to some of the other society residents to know about the Muslim burial ground being constructed on the nearby premises. One of the Raviraj Colorado society residents stated that several unknown persons are calling the society residents after the complaint to the PMC saying the Muslim burial ground will be built on survey no. 44 land come what may. “People are threatening us and saying that the inauguration of the burial ground will be executed in January next year. We all are scared and don’t want to see people getting buried there,” said Neelam Shah, one of the residents (name changed for security reasons). She further added that several Hindu organizations and concerned legal committees are looking into the case and people here are even ready to protest. “The roadway to the ground is really narrow as the locality is already crowded. Single lanes lead to the ground in question. School buses also pass through the same routes. Imagine now if someone dies from their community (God forbid) and they get the body to the ground for burial and then there’s also a bus passing through the same route.. our children will be forced to see what they should not at this age? Moreover, the traffic issues might also increase. The Muslim burial ground here is a bad idea,” she pressed. Neelam further added that the amenity space which is vacant at present is used by some of the miscreants to carry out immoral and illegal activities. On asking about the ‘immoral activities’, Shah said that people use the site for drinking and all wrong purposes after the evening hours. “This also should stop,” she demanded.The resident also added that some of the people living in the societies are leaving their properties and selling at a loss due to the increasing influence of the Muslim community. “The Muslim burial ground is making people leave their hard-earned homes. This is not done,” she adds. Another resident Jyotsna Patil (name changed for security reasons) also confirmed that most of the population staying here in the Kondhwa region is Hindu. “The burial ground can result in severe health hazards. Not instantly but in the coming 4-5 years people will notice changes in the environment here and their health to be specific. This is hazardous. Also, this is a Hindu community crowded space. Religiously, it would be incorrect to have another community burial ground here. Strict action should be taken in this case,” Patil said. The PMC is said to have taken action based on the letter submitted by BJP’s Yogesh Tilekar. However, Tilekar stated that he was misinformed about the location and that no he is ready to do anything to stop the ‘playground’ being converted into a Muslim burial ground. Reportedly, the Amenity Space Committee of Pune Municipal Corporation has taken no action on the cancellation request submitted by the BJP MLA. The decision shall be taken in the upcoming meeting of the body. At present, the amenity space contains a jogging track and a few rest places. The remaining portion of the land stands vacant. It is important to note that Pune’s Kondhwa region has been in the news for some time. In July this year, the National Investigation Agency arrested a doctor from the Kondhwa region for sheltering ISIS members. Also, three residents from the Mithanagar area of Kondhwa had been arrested by NIA for promoting terrorist activities at the behest of the global terrorist outfit Islamic State (IS). Later, in August, it had come to the fore that the accused ISIS operatives organized and participated in bomb-making workshops in Pune’s Kondhwa area in 2022. The central investigation agency received credible intelligence that these accused and their associates were recruiting youth and training them to make Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) and weapons. They also shared Do It Yourself (DIY) kits and other relevant materials among themselves for creating IEDs and manufacturing small weapons, pistols, and more. Notably, the accused were also involved in creating content for the pro-ISIS magazine ‘Voice of Hind’. The online magazine led to several raids by the NIA in October 2021 in Kashmir. On 5th August, the accused were sent to ATS custody by a Pune court. ATS informed the court they found incriminating material from the accused, including an Indian map with several cities marked, laptops containing material to study the modus operandi of terror attacks, and more. The initial probe revealed they have links to the Al Sufa module. However, a later investigation revealed they all were part of ISIS.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"14 December, 2023 ",Parliament security breach: How the intruders smuggled smoke canisters inside the high-security premises,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/parliament-security-breach-how-the-intruders-smuggled-smoke-canisters/,"Hundreds of visitors are arriving at the parliament daily, especially after the inauguration of the new parliament, however, the staff is limited. In a major security breach since the 2001 Parliament attack, two persons jumped into the Lok Sabha well on December 13 from the visitors’ gallery while the proceedings were going on and released yellow-coloured smoke from canisters. The question here arises that despite multiple security checks and frisking, how did the intruders manage to smuggle the smoke canisters inside the Parliament. Apparently, the intruders carried the smoke canisters in the shoes they were wearing.Notably, the Parliament Security Service operates under the administrative control of the Joint Secretary (Security) of the Lok Sabha Secretariat and oversees the security operations of both Secretariats. After the deadly attacks on the Parliament in 2001, several measures were taken to streamline the access points, advanced security gadgets were deployed, and a high-tech access control system was implemented to ensure the safety and security of the MPs and VVIPs. In addition, Radio Frequency Tags were introduced to enhance the identification processes.The intruders Sagar Sharma and Manoranjan managed to breach the three-tier security of the parliament. The initial check is undertaken at the Parliament premises’ entry gate. Subsequently, another check is conducted involving metal detectors and hand-held metal detector frisking. This is followed by another round of checking at the Parliament building’s entrance gate, with additional security deployed in the corridor leading to the visitors’ galleries. While the visitors were not allowed to carry cell phones inside the gallery, the intruders were skillfully carrying smoke canisters made of plastic in their shoes.An obvious question that comes to the mind here is why was the smoke cannister not detected during any of the three tiers of security checks including metal detector frisking. To understand this, one must recall the “Shoe Bomber” Richard Reid’s failed attempt to detonate a bomb on American Airlines Flight 63 from Paris to Miami 22 years back on December 22, 2001. Richard Reid had converted to Islam and joined the Islamic terrorist group Al-Qaeda. Interestingly, Reid was carrying the bomb with around 10 ounces of explosives in his shoes when he boarded the flight. Despite the prior security checks, the bomb Reid was carrying could not be detected.Fortunately, the terrorist failed in his attempt to blow up the plane mid-air as a co-passenger smelled the sulphur and Reid was then pinned down, sedated and eventually handed over to the security officials. This incident, however, demonstrated that, unless shoes are removed and checked separately, they can pass through security with plastic explosives stuffed within. For this, in the US and Europe, passengers at the airport are required to take off their shoes, belts, all metallic objects, cellphones and other electronic items in a separate tray before passing through the metal detectors.During the security checks at the parliament, the officials usually do not check the shoes of the visitors. As reported earlier, two of the accused had conducted recce outside the parliament beforehand, during the Budget session as well as the monsoon session. Had the frisking staff regularly checked the insides or the soles of the shoes of the visitors including those of the two intruders on Wednesday, the duo could have been caught beforehand. The incident has aptly triggered a serious review of the security arrangements as there could been noxious contents in the canisters smuggled in by the now-arrested intruders. Citing a Parliament Security Services official, Indian Express reported that hundreds of visitors are arriving at the parliament daily, especially after the inauguration of the new parliament, however, the staff is limited. The report adds citing sources that “301 security officers are usually deployed inside Parliament, but on Wednesday, 176 were present.”Notably, the security breach took place at 1 PM on December during the zero hour in the Lok Sabha, just before the lunch break. When Khagen Murmu, BJP MP from West Bengal, was raising some points regarding his constituency, a commotion was suddenly heard in the background. When the Sansad TV switched to the view of the entire hall, a man could be seen who had already jumped from the gallery and was on the benches. He then started to proceed towards the front of the hall, jumping from bench to bench.  #WATCH | An unidentified man jumps from the visitor's gallery of Lok Sabha after which there was a slight commotion and the House was adjourned. pic.twitter.com/Fas1LQyaO4A video from the Lok Sabha shows the members of Parliament assaulting one of the two perpetrators who burst into the chamber during proceedings and tossed canisters emitting yellow smoke. The MPs can be seen plucking the hairs of the intruder, hurling shoes at him, and landing punches at him before encircling him. Meanwhile, the Lok Sabha secretariat has reportedly suspended eight security officials in connection with the security breach. As the Winter Session of Parliament resumed this morning, security measures were significantly increased.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Char Dham temples and over 1000 other Hindu shrines in the country will be invited for this program. Invitations have also been sent to major Hindu temples across the world, and the King of Nepal. The project has cost Rs 943 crores. The Odisha government has compiled an exclusive guest list comprising prominent VIPs, corporate leaders, and celebrities for the upcoming grand event in Puri.The Odisha government is set to unveil the Jagannath Temple Corridor in Puri through an elaborate ceremony. This corridor is named the Shri Mandir Parikrama Project because it serves the major purpose of seamless circumambulation of the temple by the devotees. It has been prepared at a cost of ₹ 943 crore. It has a green buffer zone of 7 meters and a pedestrian way of 10 meters.Ranjan Kumar Das, chief administrator of the temple said, “We are inviting 857 temples in Odisha, and 180 major Indian temples including Vaishno Devi, Kamakhya Temple and Shirdi Sai temples will also be invited for the three-day inauguration event beginning from January 15. Four Holy Dhams as per Hindu religion and four other Dhams will be invited. We are sending the invitation to the King of Nepal, who enjoys special rights in Jagannath Temple. Invitations are being sent to major Hindu temples in other countries too.”The Shri Mandir Parikrama Project is designed to transform the rectangular corridor surrounding the 12th-century Jagannath Temple into a contemporary pilgrim centre, equipped with state-of-the-art amenities. These include a queue management system for 6,000 devotees, baggage screening facilities, a cloakroom capable of accommodating belongings for nearly 4,000 families, provisions for drinking water, restroom facilities, areas for hand/foot washing, information-cum-donation kiosks, shelter pavilions for shade and rest, multi-level car parking, a dedicated lane for shuttles and emergency vehicles, an integrated command and control centre, and a souvenir shop, among other features.Ranjan Kumar Das informed that Lokarpan Yajna will be performed from 15th January to 17th January 2024. He said, “Recitation of Vedas will be done at the four gates of the temple. Rigveda for eastern gate, Yajurveda for southern, Samaveda for western and Atharvaveda for northern gate have been finalised.”Uniform painting is underway for the prominent structures along the three-kilometre-long Grand Road, which links the Jagannath Temple and Mausima Temple. Additionally, all temples and subsidiary shrines will be adorned with vibrant lighting.Officials have reported the completion of all civil works for the Shri Mandir Parikrama Project, with the remaining landscaping tasks expected to conclude by the end of this calendar year.In November 2019, the process of land acquisition for the Shri Mandir Parikrama Project commenced, involving more than 600 residents residing in the vicinity of the temple relinquishing 15.64 acres deemed crucial for the establishment of a security zone. The foundation stone for the project, aimed at transforming the area within a 75-meter corridor along the boundary wall of the Jagannath Temple into a modern pilgrim centre equipped with contemporary amenities, was laid by Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik in November 2021.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"16 December, 2023 ","I don’t feel safe here, can’t even go to a park without being harassed: Pakistani actress Ayesha Omar exposes the ugly truth of her...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/thinking-to-leave-pakistan-as-i-dont-feel-safe-here-actress-ayesha-omar/,"Actress Ayesha Omar said that she is thinking of leaving Pakistan due to the present state of the economy and the lack of safety for womenFamous Pakistani actress and YouTuber Ayesha Omar recently opened up about the challenges women face in the country and related her own early experiences with harassment. She voiced her serious concerns about Pakistan’s lack of safe public spaces for women during a discussion on the Adnan Faisal Podcast. She brought attention to the problem of women feeling insecure on the streets and roads. She declared that she no longer felt secure in her native country and acknowledged the ongoing fear and uncertainty that exist there.Furthermore, she is thinking of leaving the country due to the present state of the economy and the safety of women there. “I don’t feel safe here. I want to be able to walk on the road. It’s a basic human need to be able to walk outside in the open air. All these women in your office, can you guys walk on the street? Isn’t that sad? I don’t want to sit in a car. I want to cycle. Why can’t I ride a bike,” the celebrity lamented the poor status of women’s security in the Islamic Republic. She explained the particular difficulties that Pakistani women confront and pointed out that men might never really understand the constant trepidation and stress that women experience on a daily basis. “Men can never understand what Pakistani women grow up with. As much as you try, you cannot. Because of the fear that a woman has in this country, sure, he who has daughters may understand. Being in a woman’s shoes and understanding that is impossible. You’re anxious every second.”She emphasised that safety and freedom are fundamental human needs and expressed her sincere wish for a time when women are able to move freely within their nation without dread of abduction, rape or mugging. “When will the time come when I can roam freely in my country? Without the fear of being kidnapped, without the fear of being raped, without the fear of being mugged. It’s a basic human need. Freedom and safety.”While admitting that crime exists in every nation, she argued for a shift in societal perceptions and the establishment of a safe environment in which people, especially women can stroll on the street without fear. She shared stories of being followed, catcalled and harassed in order to bring attention to the upsetting reality that many women encounter when trying to enjoy public settings.“There is crime in every country in the world. But people can, at least, walk on the road. You can’t even go to the park without ten people following you or catcalling you. They say weird things, they try to touch you. What do you do? What do you do,” the Pakistani star questioned helplessly. “We can go to the enclosed places but not everyone can afford access to these alternative spaces,” she concluded. She unveiled that the cook of her neighbour had made unwanted attempts to touch her and went on to add that she feels frightened even in posh areas. The actor pointed out that the COVID-19 shutdown was the only time she felt comfortable walking around the city. She disclosed that her mother intends to depart the nation and that her brother who was born in Pakistan now resides in Denmark.Watch the entire interview below: Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"16 December, 2023 ","India and Oman exploring Rupee trade between the two countries, utilising UPI stack in Oman’s digital economy: Foreign Secretary",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/india-and-oman-exploring-rupee-trade-between-the-two-countries-utilising-upi-stack/,"India and Oman are key partners in maritime security in the Western Indian Ocean, reflecting the depth of their cooperation.Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra on Saturday said that discussions are underway between India and Oman about utilising the UPI stack, adding that talks on the possibility of Rupee trade which is an “important element of cooperation,’ is still at the “exploratory stage”.Kwatra’s remarks came while addressing a special briefing at the Ministry of External Affairs on the State Visit of the Sultan of Oman, Haitham bin Tarik, to India.“Another element of discussion where we would try to move forward is the possibility of Rupee trade which can work between the two countries but this is still at an exploratory stage but can be an important element of cooperation going forward,” Kwatra said while responding to ANI question.On talks of digital payment cooperation between Oman and India, the Foreign Secretary said both sides discussed utilising the UPI stack with the potential corresponding digital stack in the Omanis ecosystem.“There are also other elements of the Indian stack in terms of the digital infrastructure that can be suitable to Omanis priorities with regard to using now financial inclusion and financial technology payment systems; those are only one element of it but the interface of the UPI with a corresponding Oman platform is something we can talk about,” he added.Kwatra also talked about the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) and mentioned that the negotiations have started recently, which have made substantial progress in the last few rounds of discussion and both leaders gave strong impetus to conclude it as early as possible.“An area that featured very prominently in the discussions between the two leaders was ongoing discussions between the two countries for a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement. Although the negotiations on CEPA have started only recently, they have made substantial progress in the last few rounds of discussion and both leaders gave strong impetus and push to conclude the CEPA Agreement as early as possible,” Kwatra said.Briefing further on the Sultan of Oman’s maiden visit to India, Kwatra said, “This is the first visit of Sultan of Oman to India. This is also the first state visit from Oman to India in the last 26 years. Some of you would recall that the late His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said visited India in 1997 and he was also awarded the Gandhi Peace Prize for 2019 posthumously.”The visit gained added importance due to the recent exchanges between the two nations, including Prime Minister Modi’s visit to the Sultanate of Oman in February 2018.Kwatra underscored the significance of Oman’s successful participation as a special guest country in the G20 during India’s presidency, particularly at the G20 summit in September.“Most recently in our exchanges over the last few years. PM Modi visited the Sultanate of Oman in February 2018. The visit by His Majesty is also important as it follows Oman’s very successful participation as a special guest country in the G20 during the India Presidency and their participation, particularly at the summit of the G20 in September this year,” said the Foreign Secretary.Kwatra also highlighted the strategic partnership between India and Oman, which is rooted in a long history of cultural ties and has evolved into a comprehensive collaboration spanning political, security, defence, trade, economic, cultural, and people-to-people relations. “India shares a special relationship with Oman anchored in an old history of contacts between our people today,” he said.Notably, India and Oman are key partners in maritime security in the Western Indian Ocean, reflecting the depth of their cooperation.“Our relationship has turned into a strategic partnership characterised by strong cooperation across a range of areas in diverse fields. India and Oman are partners for maritime security in the Western Indian Ocean. Both sides enjoy robust and multi-dimensional defence engagement,” the Foreign Secretary added.Kwatra acknowledged the strong bond shared by the two nations and the special role played by the Indian diaspora in Oman, numbering around seven million individuals who have significantly contributed to the development of Oman’s economy.“Oman is also home to a large Indian diaspora. About seven Indians called Oman their home and, in the process, made significant and meaningful contributions to the development of the Omanis economy,” he also said.Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held delegation-level talks with the Sultan of Oman, Haitham bin Tarik, at Hyderabad House in New Delhi.“Transforming India-Oman ties! PM @narendramodi held productive discussions with His Majesty Sultan Haitham bin Tarik of Oman.

They also exchanged perspectives on regional and international issues,” posted MEA spokersperson Arindam Bagchi on X, following their meeting.The two leaders adopted a new ‘India-Oman joint vision, a partnership for the future’ under which both countries will work in ten different areas.The Sultan of Oman was also accorded a ceremonial reception at the forecourt of Rashtrapati Bhavan in New Delhi on Saturday, the second day of his state visit to India.The Sultan was received by Union Minister of State (MoS) for External Affairs, V Muraleedharan, as he arrived at the Delhi airport on Friday for a three-day state visit.(This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

He made the remarks while addressing the Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra in Sanand, Gujarat’s Ahmedabad district. Addressing the gathering in Gujarati, Home Minister Shah said, “In 2002, there were riots and thereafter Modi saheb taught a lesson to not repeat the act. Have there been riots thereafter? The rioters were taught such a lesson in 2002 that to date no one dares to cause riots in Gujarat.”ચાંગોદર, સાણંદ (ગુજરાત) ખાતે 'વિકસિત ભારત સંકલ્પ યાત્રા'માં જનતા સાથે સંવાદ… https://t.co/W5WTKGanLHHe also listed out the major achievements of the Modi government in the last nine-and-a-half years and credited the Prime Minister for abrogating Article 370 “in a jiffy”. He lauded PM Modi for improving the safety of the country and highlighted the recurrent bomb blasts across the country before 2014. Shah also highlighted the construction of Bhavya Ram Mandir which was otherwise housed in a ‘tent’. He added, “PM Narendra Modi worked to secure India by carrying out surgical strikes on Pakistan, realised the incomplete dream of abrogation of Article 370, undertook the work of constructing Lord Ram temple in Ayodhya, took India to the Moon through Chandrayaan mission, improved economic parameters to their best since independence, and led to the highest industrial development since independence.” Shah further noted, “Earlier, every day, we would have bomb blasts, print journalists would forget to print, and there would be so many blasts with no end to it. But with a surgical and air strike once, we taught Pakistan a lesson…Narendrabhai has made the country safer.”The Home Minister asserted, “The entire world reached the Moon but our flag could not. Narendrabhai sent Chandrayaan to the Moon and at Shivshakti point made our tricolour fly high. He has worked such that in the country’s economy, all parameters have been at their best in the past 75 years. If one takes 10-year intervals, industrial development has been the most during Narendrabhai’s tenure.” However, Shah argued that improving the quality of life of 60 crore poor people in the country has been the biggest achievement of the Narendra Modi government.“Several times, journalists ask me as to which of Narendra Modi’s achievements will get my highest marks. I say this without any controversy, confusion or dilemma that if I have to give the highest marks, then it will be Modi’s work to improve the quality of life of 60 crore poor,” he was quoted saying by The New Indian Express.Meanwhile, during the Sanand gram panchayat event, Shah also urged people to take a pledge to transform India into a developed country by 2047 while eradicating the “slavery mentality from its root”.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"16 December, 2023 ","Parliament security breach: Police say perpetrators wanted to create anarchy in the country, sixth accused arrested and sent to 7-day police custody",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/parliament-security-breach-police-say-perpetrators-wanted-to-create-anarchy-in-the-country/,"Police said about the accused persons in the parliament security breach: ""he alongwith others wanted to create anarchy in the country so that they can compel the government to meet their unjust and illegal demands"".The Patiala House Court here on Saturday granted seven-day custody of Mahesh Kumawat, the sixth accused in the Parliament security breach case, to the Police.Delhi Police sought 15 days of custodial remand of accused Mahesh Kumawat. He is the sixth accused arrested in the case.Police claimed, “he alongwith others wanted to create anarchy in the country so that they can compel the government to meet their unjust and illegal demands”.According to the Police, Mahesh was associated with the other accused for the last 2 years. He was the part of the conspiracy. He attended almost all the meetings held between them. He is actively involved in the act of destruction of a mobile phone and evidence with the key accused Lalit Jha.Lalit Jha, the fifth accused and mastermind in Parliament security breach case, has burnt the mobile phones of his associates along with his friend Mahesh after fleeing to Rajasthan’s Kuchaman, said police sources.Ahead of the incident, all four accused had handed over their mobile phones to Jha so that crucial investigation details cannot get into police hands as they were anticipating their arrest.Jha met his friend Mahesh, who got him a room for the night. Both of them had met through Facebook, as revealed by Jha during his interrogation.The security breach happened on the anniversary of the 2001 Parliament terror attack. Two people–Sagar Sharma and Manoranjan D–jumped into the Lok Sabha chamber from the public gallery during Zero Hour, released yellow gas from canisters and shouted anti-establishment slogans before being overpowered by the MPs.Outside it, in another incident, two protestors — Neelam (42) and Amol (25) — protested outside the Parliament with similar gas canisters. However, all four were sent to seven-day custody of Delhi Police Special Cell on Thursday.Last night, senior police officials, including two Deputy Commissioners of Police (DCP) and Additional Commissioners of Police, interrogated Lalit Jha, during which he narrated the whole incident to officials. According to sources, during interrogation, it came to light that preparations for the security breach were being made months ago. An entry pass was necessary for entry into Parliament; hence, it was not available.Lalit had asked everyone who could arrange the pass so that they could easily enter Parliament. From a hotel in Rajasthan Lalit was continuously keeping an eye on ongoing developments and police movements through news channels, they said. According to sources, to unearth more details in the case, the Special Cell of Delhi Police has formed six teams that will go to the locations linked with the accused in Lucknow, Mysore, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Haryana.The investigation also revealed that two pairs of shoes were made on special order in Lucknow, as the accused discovered that shoes do not get checked in Parliament and this can be an easy way to carry the smoke canister inside the parliament. Meanwhile, Special Cell will recreate the scene of Wednesday’s Parliament security breach by taking the accused to the Parliament complex on Saturday or Sunday, sources said. According to sources, the accused will be taken to Parliament to recreate the scene of the crime. This will help the police find out how the accused entered the Parliament building with colour spray and how they executed their plan, sources from the Special Cell said. (This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

The High Court asked for a policy within a week. CM Bhagwant Mann is the jail minister. What did he do?… Drug tablets are being sold inside the jails… If I am proven a liar, I will leave politics,” Sidhu said, speaking to reporters on Saturday.The Punjab and Haryana High Court has recently sought a status report from the Punjab and Haryana governments on the steps taken after the BSF gave a list of 75 individuals suspected of involvement in drug trafficking to the Punjab Police.The High Court took cognizance of a news article published in an English newspaper that mentioned that the Border Security Force (BSF) gave a list of 75 individuals suspected of involvement in drug trafficking to the Punjab Police.Moreover, the High Court has made the Punjab and Haryana governments and the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) parties in this case and has issued a notice and ordered them to file their replies.According to the data released by BSF, BSF has seized around 755 kg of narcotics so far in the year 2023. 95 drones coming from Pakistan have been shot down. 36 Pakistani nationals have been arrested, of whom 15 rifles and 38 pistols have been recovered.

"16 December, 2023 ",‘Dharavi tender was finalised transparently when MVA govt was in power’: Adani group responds to Uddhav Thackeray’s allegations against the redevelopment project,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/adani-group-responds-to-uddhav-thackerays-allegations-against-the-dharavi-project/,"""It is unfortunate that a concerted effort is being made to disseminate misinformation about certain aspects of the project,"" a press release issued by Adani Group said after Uddhav Thackeray launched a protest against the projectOn 16th December (Saturday), Adani Group released a press statement asserting that the project for the redevelopment of the Dharavi slum in Mumbai was awarded to the Adani Group through a fair, open, and internationally competitive bidding process. The group highlighted that the tender conditions were finalised when the MVA government was in power.The official response from the company came in the backdrop that Shiv Sena (UBT) leader and former Maharashtra CM  Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday led a protest march of the party, alleging favour to Adani Group in connection with the Dharavi redevelopment project.Adani Group says, ""The Dharavi project was awarded to the Adani Group through a fair, open, internationally competitive bidding process.

Hence, it is wrong to claim that any special benefits have been given to the awardee.” #WATCH | Mumbai, Maharashtra | Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray led a protest march of the party, alleging favour to Adani Group in connection with the Dharavi redevelopment project.Visuals of the protest from earlier today, at T Junction of Dharavi area. pic.twitter.com/zFlevoCjX7The group reiterated that all eligible tenement holders will be moved into their new homes in Dharavi itself. As per the tender conditions, even ineligible tenement holders will be provided accommodation under the Rental Housing Policy. The tender provisions also ensure that eligible residential tenements will receive 17% more area than other SRA projects in Mumbai, the statement added.Meanwhile, addressing the protesters, Uddhav Thackeray alleged that the redevelopment project involves TDR irregularities worth more than Rs 100 crore, which is the “biggest scam in the world”. Leading the march from Dharavi to Adani office in Bandra, the former CM demanded that the government should redevelop the slum, not the Adani Group, and Dharavi residents should get the houses they deserve. Regarding the TDR allegations, the Adani group stressed that the resettlement of Dharavikars is not affected by Transferable Development Rights (TDR). Also, the TDR from the project will be managed and monitored transparently through a specially created portal by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) and the Government of Maharashtra, the group added in its press release.CM Eknath Shinde also countered Uddhav Thackeray for his opposition to the project, saying that when Uddhav Thackeray became the CM under the MVA alliance, he had stalled many projects started by the earlier BJP-Shiv Sena government, which had impeded the development of the state. Notably, in July, the Maharashtra government officially awarded the Dharavi Redevelopment project, spanning 259 hectares, to an Adani group firm.The Maharashtra government has entered into a 99-year lease agreement with the Indian Railways and then it will be sub-leased on 30 years+30 years basis like any other government land in Mumbai to the housing societies. There is no change in this policy for the Dharavi Redevelopment Project, the release added.The official release has been issued through the Spokesperson of Dharavi Redevelopment Project Private Ltd (DRPPL). In the statement, the Spokesperson added, “There is a general consensus, not only in Mumbai and Maharashtra but also across the whole of India, for transforming Dharavi and providing the people of Dharavi with better living conditions, adequate hygiene, education, and vocational training, healthcare, employment opportunities, essential amenities and a life of dignity.”The DRPPL stressed that the Dharavi project assumes added significance because many earlier attempts have failed to deliver. “There is no gainsaying the fact that a transformational project like Dharavi needs support from all stakeholders, including from political parties cutting across ideologies and differences. This is a historic opportunity to build a new, state-of-the-art Dharavi which reflects the hopes and aspirations of Dharavikars,” the press release further added. It is important to note that in August 2023, the Maharashtra government filed an affidavit regarding the project in the Bombay High Court. The affidavit stated that the tender process for the Dharavi redevelopment project was “absolutely transparent” and “no undue favour” was given to the highest bidder, Adani Group.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

He claimed they intended to convert his daughter to Islam. The victim's father expressed his apprehension that if the girl is not found soon, the perpetrators might harm her.On Friday (December 15), a 20-year-old girl was abducted in Uttar Pradesh’s Kushinagar at about 4 a.m. The girl had gone out to attend nature’s call with her mother at the time when accused Izmamul Ansari, Alamgir, Meraj Ansari, and Naushad Ansari came in their Bolero car and abducted her. In this case, the victim’s family has appealed to the police to bring the girl back. According to the father of the kidnapped girl, the kidnappers were recognised by his wife, who is from the same village but belongs to a different community. He claimed they intended to convert his daughter to Islam. The victim’s father expressed his apprehension that if the girl is not found soon, the perpetrators might harm her.This incident occurred in the Kushinagar district’s Ramkola police station precinct. The girl’s mother screamed for help, but the abductors forced her face against the wall and took the victim with them. The victim’s father said that the abductors fled in their Bolero car along with the girl as soon as the villagers gathered. According to media reports, all of the perpetrators have been identified, and an FIR has been registered. Moreover, the police have apprehended three people so far. The FIR also names a woman identified as Quresha Ansari. Quresha is allegedly involved in the religious conversion conspiracy along with the accused persons.

"16 December, 2023 ","As politicians in Bihar bat for caste census, here is how caste politics took Bihar’s economy to the bottom",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/how-caste-politics-took-bihars-economy-to-bottom/,"While the ruling dispensation in Bihar has billed caste census as a game-changer, a telling report by Shamika Ravi for The Economic Times sheds light on the role of caste politics in driving the economy of Bihar to the rock-bottom. Bihar's struggle at the economic front coincided with the advent of caste politics around 1992, marking a turning point for the state's fortunes in a negative direction.Caste-based census data was released in Bihar amid an atmosphere of celebration among the supporters of RJD and JDU, the two main ruling parties of Bihar. It was projected as if the state government had delivered some huge public welfare scheme. But the reality is that it is the caste politics in Bihar took the state’s economy to the bottom. Bihar has been considered a poor state for decades now. It is one of the ‘bimaru’ (meaning ill) states. The acronym is obtained by joining the initials of backward states in north India including Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh. All the development indices in these states would normally be on the lower side. Between the 1980s and 2020s, there was a time when the economy of Bihar saw a reverse shift from a slowly growing phase to a declining phase before coming back to a nominal positive track. In the 1980s, Odisha was a state poorer than Bihar. And over these four decades, Odisha has maintained steady growth. Today Odisha has outgrown Bihar on economic indices.According to a report by Shamika Ravi for ‘The Economic Times’, Bihar has consistently held the unfortunate distinction of being the most impoverished among large states in recent decades. However, it is worth noting that historically, this was not the case. In 1991, Odisha was even more economically deprived than Bihar. Hence, it is fitting to examine and juxtapose the experiences of the two most impoverished states, evaluating what has been gained and lost over the past four decades.In the report authored by Shamika Ravi – a member of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister – this period of comparative consideration of the two states is divided into three parts viz. 1980 to 1991 (before the economic crisis), 1992 to 2002 (emergence of caste politics, economic reforms and division of states) and post-2002 (growth and development).The report cites that in 1980, Bihar held the title of the poorest large state, with a per capita GDP (at 2015 prices) of ₹12,553, trailing behind Odisha, which recorded ₹17,256—a gap of nearly 37%. However, despite this initial disparity, Bihar exhibited a robust average annual per capita GDP growth rate of 5.1%, outpacing Odisha’s slower growth rate of 1.4%. Consequently, due to Bihar’s significant economic growth throughout the decade, by 1991, its per capita GDP had exceeded that of Odisha, standing at ₹21,282 compared to Odisha’s ₹20,591.Despite Bihar initially having a higher per capita GDP than Odisha, this era marked a significant shift in the fortunes of the two states. The prevalence of caste politics and lawlessness also known as the Jungle Raj triggered an unprecedented reversal in Bihar’s average annual growth rate, plummeting from +5.1% (1980-1991) to -0.6% (1992-2002). In contrast, Odisha doubled its growth rate from 1.4% (1980-1991) to 3% (1992-2002). This divergence resulted in Bihar’s per capita GDP dropping by almost 33%, declining from ₹21,282 in 1991 to ₹14,209 in 2002. Conversely, Odisha experienced a 31% increase, growing from ₹20,591 in 1991 to ₹26,881 in 2002. Factors such as caste politics, poor governance, and lawlessness pushed Bihar behind Odisha, widening the per capita GDP gap from +3.4% in 1992 to -47% in 2002.Bihar’s economic trajectory underwent a notable shift with a transition from caste politics and lawlessness to a renewed focus on agriculture and women’s well-being. In the post-2002 period, Bihar witnessed a remarkable average annual growth rate of 5.6%, propelling its per capita GDP from ₹14,209 in 2002 to ₹37,050 in 2019—an impressive 161% increase. Concurrently, Odisha experienced a 4.7% average annual growth rate during the same period, leading to a surge in per capita GDP from ₹26,881 in 2002 to ₹86,287 in 2019—a substantial 221% growth. As of 2019, Odisha’s per capita GDP surpassed Bihar’s by 130%.The per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Bihar and Odisha as of 2023 is Rs 49470 and Rs 150676 respectively. Odisha’s per capita GDP is thus thrice that of Bihar. Through a counterfactual analysis of per capita GDP, projections were made based on the average annual growth rates achieved by Bihar and Odisha from 1980 to 1991. If Bihar had sustained its growth at the rate of 5.1%, the projected per capita GDP would have been ₹95,313 in 2019—significantly higher by 257% compared to the actual figure of ₹37,050. This stark contrast highlights the true opportunity cost incurred by Bihar due to regressive caste politics during the 1990s. Had Bihar sustained its economic progress from 1980 to 1991, it would have evolved into a markedly different state economically.In contrast, if Odisha had maintained an annual growth rate of 1.4% (its average rate from 1980-91), the projected per capita GDP would have been ₹29,782 in 2019. This amount represents only 35% of the actual per capita GDP, which stood at ₹86,287 in 2019. This comparison underscores the potential growth that Odisha forewent by not matching the growth trajectory of the 1980-91 period. If Odisha had persisted in its lacklustre economic performance, it would currently hold the undesirable distinction of being the most impoverished state, surpassing Bihar.The impact of caste politics and lawlessness on the economy is clear. Bihar’s economic downturn during the 1992-2002 period, characterized by these challenges, led to a significant and lasting decline in prosperity, marked by a substantial drop in per capita GDP. This comparison with Odisha highlights Bihar’s ongoing challenges in fully recovering from the setbacks endured during that tumultuous decade. This decade is when Lalu Prasad Yadav was at the peak of his politics. Rashtriya Janata Dal was bringing together Muslim and Yadav votes to secure power in the state only to turn the democratic administration into a Jungle Raj.The recent political shifts in Bihar, veering towards caste politics instead of prioritizing economic growth, stand as a stark reminder of the potential repercussions. Contemplating the 1992-2002 period underscores the enduring costs borne by the weaker sections, women, and socially backward groups. It serves as a poignant reflection on the persisting challenges of caste politics and misgovernance, emphasising that they are enduring problems rather than solutions to economic and social backwardness. Despite numbers suggesting that caste politics has pulled Bihar back for a decade, politicians from Bihar resorted to the caste census in 2023. As per data released by the Bihar government, 36.01% of the state’s population is categorised as belonging to the extremely backward class, while 27.12% falls under the backward class. The remaining 15.52% of the population is reported to belong to the unreserved or general category.It’s important to note that the term ‘Extremely Backward Class’ refers to the EBC community, consisting of 130 castes and sub-castes in Bihar, a categorization that has long been on Nitish Kumar’s agenda. This separate classification aims at mobilizing non-Yadav backward castes, excluding OBC castes like Yadav and Kurmi.The question arises whether two distinct groups, namely EBC and OBC, will be formed, each with its unique mobilization strategy. The answer to these questions remains uncertain, and only time will provide clarity. However, the possibility of joint fronts comprising various castes emerging against more influential castes within the OBC is a potential outcome, and similar experiments have been conducted in the past, suggesting a potentially accelerated process this time.If OBC and EBC are amalgamated in Bihar, they collectively constitute 63%. The ‘Caste Census’ report mentions a total of 203 castes, with 196 of them being eligible for reservations.In summary, Bihar’s economic journey reflects a series of ups and downs, with the state transitioning from being the poorest in the 1980s to a phase of decline in the 1990s marked by caste politics and lawlessness. The post-2002 period saw a revival, focusing on agriculture and women’s well-being. However, recent political shifts back towards caste politics raise concerns about sustained economic growth. The 2023 caste census introduces additional complexities, posing questions about potential social divisions. The future implications remain uncertain, and only time will unveil Bihar’s intricate interplay between caste dynamics, politics, and economic development.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"16 December, 2023 ","Parliament security breach: Accused initially planned self-immolation, had wanted to start political party through media attention",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/parliament-security-breach-accused-self-immolation-political-party/,"According to the information shared by the officer, these intruders wanted to stage the self-immolation without getting any serious burn injuriesOn Friday (15th December) new updates surfaced during the investigation of the parliament security breach case. It is found in the police probe that the accused initially planned to set themselves ablaze outside the parliament but the plan was abandoned. The police are also checking if there is a foreign funding angle in this case.On Friday, the investigators said that the individuals who infiltrated Parliament security and released yellow smoke within the Lok Sabha sought to attract media attention to establish a political party. They believed that it was the most effective means to articulate and convey their ‘opinions’. One of the arrested accused Sagar Sharma told police that the intruders had initially planned to set themselves ablaze outside the parliament. Later this plan was abandoned. The investigating officer said, “He said that to form a political party, they had to do something that would get them media attention. He said that they didn’t want to align with any other political party because their ideology didn’t match.”According to the information shared by the officer, these intruders wanted to stage the self-immolation without getting any serious burn injuries. For this, they had also planned to buy a gel-like material so that they would not burn. The officer said, “He said that they tried to buy this gel online and also collected money but couldn’t get through with the payment.”On Friday, the Delhi police also submitted the details of the case unearthed so far in front of the Patiala house court. The police said that Lalit Jha was the mastermind of the entire parliament security breach episode conspiracy. The police asserted that the intruders wanted to create anarchy in the country to force the government to meet their demands. The police may also seek permission to recreate the crime scene in the new parliament. Lalit Jha is sent to 7 days police custody for further interrogation. The police contended in the court that the accused held multiple meetings before executing this attack. The police sought the custody of the accused to ascertain if he was attached to any terror outfit or enemy country. The police said in the court, “Jha disclosed that they wanted to create anarchy in the country so that they can compel the government to meet their demands. He took the phones (of other accused) to hide them and to destroy evidence as part of the larger conspiracy. He disclosed that he threw his phone away on the way from Jaipur to Delhi. His custody is needed to undertake an in-depth investigation to unearth the larger conspiracy behind the attack, involvement of other persons, and to find the actual motive behind the attack.”The police further told the court, “We need him to confront the accused with each other, to locate the mobile phones, to take him to the hotel where stayed for four days, and to know the financial transaction and funding behind the attack.”The investigations are also going on to check if there was any kind of foreign funding to these intruders to execute this security breach in the parliament. Authorities suspect the engagement of foreign funding, given the accused’s strategic planning and repeated visits to Delhi for recce. The police are also actively seeking the individual who assisted them in creating shoes with concealed compartments to hide canisters.A senior police officer mentioned that police will be taking Jha to Rajasthan to trace the places where he threw his phone and burnt the phones of others. The officer said, “After the incident, he fled to Rajasthan where he stayed for two days and returned to Delhi last night.”According to the police, the primary hurdle in this case lies in the absence of the accused individuals’ mobile phones, which could be instrumental in tracking the origins of the conspiracy and determining the potential involvement of additional individuals. The officer added, “We are planning to approach Parliament to seek permission for recreating the crime scene inside the House and outside the Parliament building. Lalit Jha, who was arrested on Thursday, revealed during the interrogation that he had thrown his phone on the Delhi-Jaipur highway and destroyed the phones of the other accused.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"14 December, 2023 ","N Ram pats his own back for a pompous, gassy editorial in The Hindu, The Wire has a monumental meltdown: Fallout of SC decision...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/n-ram-pompous-editorial-the-hindu-the-wire-meltdown-sc-decision-article-370/,"N.Ram, Siddarth Varadarajan and their ilk know very well that the Parliament can split or not split a state even when there is an elected government in place and the legislature wishes otherwise.On December 11th, the Supreme Court upheld the abolition of the dreaded Article 370 (I know it was repealed and therefore while Article 370 still exists in the Constitution, the original dreaded purpose for which it was intended doesn’t exist anymore). Certain sections of the English media; certain sections of the I.N.D.I alliance and the entire Congress party went bonkers over this decision of the Supreme Court. Watching their meltdowns gave me goosebumps, literally. Am sure that their WhatsApp groups buzzed with messages on what should be their best strategy on this topic. The line of argument they have chosen to bombard their readers/viewers is – Attack on Federalism! A long, pompous and gassy editorial was published in his newspaper, The Hindu (we will get it later in this article). N. Ram showed utmost humility and described his editorial as “clear-sighted and insightful”. A former CEO of The Hindu group of publications, Rajiv C. Lochan, dared to call out this humility of N.Ram on Twitter here (“Beware when one pats one’s own back”. He went on to comment that “the pervasive use of adjectives can’t strengthen a relatively weak set of arguments”. Rajiv Lochan was telling N. Ram that just because he used good English doesn’t mean that this editorial is insightful. Now, the unparalleled arrogance of N. Ram is well known. Occasionally he takes it upon himself to prove it yet again to all his readers. Rajiv Lochan provided the best opportunity for N. Ram to exhibit his famed arrogance and intolerance in public. True to his image, N. Ram use a lot of English words to convey a simple meaning. I would urge you to read the image below and have a hearty laugh at N. Ram’s meltdown! He is telling Rajiv Lochan that a mere CEO should shut up because there is no one better than N.Ram to have opinions in this whole world. How can a mere CEO comment in public about matters as trivial as Article 370? Imagine N. Ram’s attitude towards mere citizens if he goes bombastic like this on his former CEO! After reading the “clear-sighted and insightful” editorial about 3 to 5 times, I was able to find 2 sentences that summarized the arguments of the entire English media gang. The title of the editorial makes it sound like doomsday is near and we will die because of what the Supreme Court did! I have highlighted the relevant portion in the editorial that tells us that Parliament can now do anything while keeping a state under the President’s rule. This was what his compatriots at The Wire were also shrieking about. The meltdown at The Wire was even more monumental in proportions. Multiple opinion pieces popped up in a short time – all telling us the same thing – that there is no difference left between “democracy and dictatorship”; that there are “Serious implications” for the entire country; that this is an “attack on the basic structure of federalism”; and the best of all – Many “locals had feared” that they have been pushed into “meaningful silence”!Think about what these people are writing folks. What is wrong with “meaningful silence”? What is wrong with anything that is classified as “meaningful”? How can you use the word “meaningful” as a consequence of having “fear” to want it? N.Ram, Siddarth Varadarajan and their ilk know very well that the Parliament can split or not split a state even when there is an elected government in place and the legislature wishes otherwise. When she was the CM of UP, Mayawati passed a resolution in the UP Assembly asking the centre to split into 4 states. The then Home Minister flatly rejected the resolution. The disastrous manner in which AP was split into TS and AP is still fresh in many minds. The AP Legislature resolved that the state should not be split. Did that stop Sonia Gandhi from taking a stand otherwise? Examples galore exist on this topic. Starting from 1956 when their hero Nehru suspended the first elected communist government in the world in Kerala using a “brute majority” in Parliament. We can further discuss the language of Articles 1,2 and 3 in the Constitution of India. It wouldn’t serve any purpose for these people. We are approaching 10 years of Modi government. Despite their wonderful knowledge of the English language, these editors and owners have not been able to find new words, in the past 10 years, to describe their contempt towards the people of India for electing Modi. By rehashing the same words, and in the garb of being “insightful” and “clear-sighted”, all that these people have succeeded in was to show us how blinded they are to the reality of a new emerging Bharat. A Bharat that will embrace all meaningful decisions and leave behind all the meaningless trash these people dish out every day. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"13 December, 2023 ","As TV reporters shamelessly fight for smoke canister thrown in Parliament, here are a few things we should all be worried about after witnessing...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/journalists-fight-colour-canister-parliament-few-things-we-should-be-worried-about/,"If one truly thinks about it, the current TV journalists are merely following the standards set by veteran journalists like Rajdeep Sardesai who admitted that they were like vultures. On the 13th of December 2023, there was a serious security breach in the Parliament of India. Two individuals hurled a smoke canister from the viewer gallery. They then jumped to the floor of the house and were trying to make their way towards the speaker when were overpowered by parliamentarians. Thereafter they were detained by the police and taken for interrogation. Just as the security breach took place, there were two individuals outside the parliament protesting with similar colour smoke canisters. According to preliminary information from the Delhi Police, there is no terror angle to the incidents, however, the police are taking the breach seriously. According to reports, the intruder inside the parliament was chanting slogans about “Kaala Kanoon” and the protestors outside the Parliament were chanting slogans like Jai Bhim, Tanashahi Nahi Chalegi, Manipur ko Insaf do, etc. While the country was shocked by the serious security breach and the ramifications of the lapse, Indian media was conducting their very own circus. A video emerged where TV journalists were seen fighting like animals over the smoke canister that was hurled by the protestors. In the video put out by TV9, their journalist was showing the smoke canister on camera. While he was doing his segment, other journalists started trying to snatch the canister saying that he had used it enough and should hand over the canister to other journalists. When the other journalists started trying to snatch the canister, the TV9 journalist was seen almost sprinting with it, trying to get a few more seconds with the canister – for the sake of the hard-hitting coverage of the unfolding incident at the Parliament. As the nation had important questions that the media should have been focussing on – like how this security breach took place, who were the intruders, what were they chanting, why they did what they did, what was the police doing and how visitors entered the parliament with canisters and why were the Delhi Police so lackadaisical in arrested the protestors outside the Parliament, almost looking like they were taking them for a walk, these elements in the media seemed far more interested in ridiculous sensationalism and showing visuals of the canister. While we watched this circus unfold, there are several important aspects that people need to be extremely worried about. First and foremost, one has to wonder about the priorities of the media and what they choose to cover when important events unfold. As mentioned, there are very important questions that need to be answered as this security breach unfolds. The Parliament is not just a building but a symbol of the democracy of India and the seat of power. Any attack on the Parliament is an attack on democracy and the sovereignty of India itself. While these events unfolded, the journalists on the ground should have been far more focused on bringing crucial details to the people of the nation. And while several journalists were doing so, some were indulging in cheap sensationalism. This, however, comes as no surprise. One is reminded of the time when Rajdeep Sardesai was talking about the 2001 Parliament Attack – the terrorist attack that incidentally took place on this day 22 years ago. In 2018, a video had gone viral where Rajdeep Sardesai admitted that journalists were vultures. Sardesai in the video recounted the December 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament where he and his crew were preparing for a picnic owing to a slow news day. Preparing for a feast in the garden near the Parliament, he and his team entered the Parliament at around 11 am. Within minutes of the team entering the Parliament, he says they heard gunshots. The Parliament was attacked. He then recalled that when his colleague asked him to leave, he directed him to suggest the guard to close the gates. He explained with a wide grin that he did so so that no other channel crew could enter. Those days there were fewer channels and Sardesai was excited at the prospect of doing an exclusive story.He then says how the exclusive story of the parliament attack made the team forget the wine and kababs they were planning to picnic on. “It was a great day. We are like vultures. We feed on these moments.” he added.If one truly thinks about it, the current TV journalists are merely following the standards set by veteran vultures like Rajdeep Sardesai. While the conduct of the media was abysmal, what is far more concerning is the conduct of the Delhi Police and security agencies. When a security breach like this has taken place, one would imagine that the police and law enforcement agencies would ask the media to stand back – after all, 26/11 was a classic case of how the media could potentially jeopardise any rescue operation and investigation when such incidents take place. During the Mumbai Attack, the police allowed unbridled access to the media, resulting in journalists like Barkha Dutt potentially giving away crucial information on hostages from ISI handlers who were closely monitoring the media. Taking a lesson from the past, the police should have summarily kept the media away. That canister itself could be crucial evidence that the police need, instead, the media was yet again given unbridled access to play with the canister as if were some sort of a prop in a drama. On the 22nd anniversary of the ghastly 2001 Parliament attack, the parliament was under severe threat. There were Khalistani and other terror organisations which had issued threats against the Parliament. While now the police are claiming that the smoke was not harmful, while the breach was ongoing, the police had to function under the assumption that it could be a deadly terror attack which could have dire ramifications. Despite that, the media was given unbridled access knowing fully well that such media has a history of creating a circus during serious incidents. Several other questions are being raised against the police as the Parliament’s security was breached. Visitors to the Parliament are frisked at every stage and there are now questions being asked as to how the security could have been so wanting that two individuals with smoke canisters could enter the Parliament. Per protocol, those who have passes to view the Parliament proceedings are not allowed to carry a paper inside the Parliament. Legitimate concerns are now being raised as to how, amid such tight security, two individuals could enter with these canisters. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"11 December, 2023 ",Chadar of sanitised history over ugly side of ‘Sufi saints’: I got death threats by Islamists for talking about historical facts – so let...,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/nupur-j-sharma-moinuddin-chisti-sufi-saints-demand-arrest-threats-statement/,"Since the Islamists have been relentlessly demanding my arrest, I must place on record that if needed, I will be more than willing to defend my position in a court of law.On the 2nd of December, I interviewed the Son of Hamas – Mosab Hassan Yousef. He is the son of one of the founders of Hamas Sheikh Hassan Yousef. The interview was necessitated after a Hindu boy from Kashmir started getting Sar Tan Se Juda threats after he shared an old interview snippet of Yousef, where he was talking about Islam. After the boy from NIT Srinagar was threatened by the Islamist mob, Yousef took to his X page and posted that the Jihadis should go after him and leave the boy alone. In his interview with me, he categorically said that if anyone touched the Hindu boy, the repercussions would be dire. Beyond the NIT Srinagar case, Yousef and I also spoke at length about Islam, Islamism and the fate of the rest of the world in the face of a cult that was perpetually offended and believed that the use of violence to express that offence was their divine right – nay – duty. During the discussion, Yousef mentioned how Sufism was one of the most peaceful, spiritual branches of Islam. A Hindu, however, knows that this statement rings hollow. I told Yousef that as a Hindu, I find it difficult to make sense of that perception since Hindus have been raped and murdered by Sufis. As an example of the Sufi onslaught against Hindus, I cited the example of Moinuddin Chisti, how cows were slaughtered and Hindu Temples desecrated and also alluded to the Ajmer Dargah rape scandal where the self-proclaimed descendants of Moinuddin Chisti and the custodians of his legacy raped hundreds of Hindu girls and blackmailed them – a sordid saga from 1992. It is pertinent to mention here that I don’t blame Mosab Hassan Yousef for the views he holds on Sufism. Many Hindus themselves believe that Sufism is peaceful and spiritual. In fact, a chunk of the business that the Amer Dargah gets is from Hindus who visit the shrine – not Muslims. Even though it was some of the Chistis associated with the Ajmer Dargah who had issued death threats to Nupur Sharma and called for her beheading. Khadim Gauhar Chishti of Ajmer Dargah had links to Kanhaiya Lal’s murder. Khadim of Ajmer Dargah named Gauhar Chishti had met one of the killers of the Hindu tailor. Ajmer Dargah Khadim Salman Chishti threatened to kill Nupur Sharma. The history-sheeter with over 13 cases filed against him, including murder and attempt to murder, claimed that he would hand over his house to anyone who brings Sharma’s head. Sarwar Chishti of the Anjuman Committee of the Ajmer dargah had said “The situation in the country right now, is such that people are committing blasphemy. They are doing mischief in the glory of the Prophet, in the glory of the Khwaja. We will not tolerate this at all. We will launch such a massive agitation that the whole Hindustan will shake.” Sarwar Chishti had called himself a member of the PFI. In 2020, he defended PFI saying the organisation was ”saving India’s constitution”. He had also called for a boycott of Hindus. Syed Aadil Chishti – son of Sarwar Chishti – mocked Hindu deities after the Nupur Sharma incident.Nothing I said was historically inaccurate and I will come to that. Days after the interview, a clip where I mentioned Moinuddin Chisti was shared on social media by Islamists, claiming that I had insulted the Sufi ‘saint’ and I should be arrested. What started with the hashtag #ArrestNupurJSharma soon turned into a free-for-all – I got death threats, rape threats and the usual ‘Sar Tan se Juda’ threats. My reaction was the chuckle at the irony of it all. After all, my statement came just as it was being claimed that Sufis are peaceful and spiritual – a model for all Muslims to follow. Here is a sneak peak into their spiritual moorings: While the peaceful Sufis demanded for my head and arrest, I held my peace for 3 days – not because I was scared but because I believed that their outrage would die down. It did not. I believe sunlight is the best disinfectant. I believe the truth – historical facts – can’t be suppressed simply because some people are offended by it. As an American conservative says, ‘facts don’t care about your feelings’. I have repeated over and over again the purpose of my professional existence – I picked up my pen because ‘they’ sold theirs. I would not do justice to my role or my readers if I don’t stand by the truth. If I cower today. And therefore, I feel it necessary to substantiate my statement with historical evidence. With regards to Sufism, there is a broad perception that it is a peaceful, spiritual sect of Islam. However, there are certain myths attached to this notion that need honest conversation. Historically, several genocides against Hindus and crimes against their faith/places of worship have been led by Sufis or have been conducted at the behest of Sufis. It is a matter of historical record that eighteenth-century Sufi preacher Shah Waliullah’s letters to Islamic rulers and nobles show that he was very keen on rejuvenating Islamic supremacy in Delhi, which had started to loosen its grip over the sub-continent after Aurangzeb’s death. According to the book by Saiyid Athar Abbas Rizvi, Shah Waliullah wrote a letter to Ahmad Shah Abdali, the invader from Afghanistan, inviting him to India to establish Islamic supremacy by suppressing Hindus.From the invite to Ahmad Shah Abdali to the mastermind of the Noakhali genocide belonging to a Sufi sect – Shah Syed Gholam Sarwar Husseini, the hereditary pir of Dayra Sharif, a Sufi shrine in Noakhali, Sufism has a chequered history – one which is well documented – a history of genocide, enslavement, forced conversion and establishment of the supremacy of Islam. Those Sufis who refused to adhere to Orthodox Islam were persecuted – the sects we talk about today were not. MA Khan writes that Sufi leaders had poured into India along with the Turkic invaders and most of them, Nizamuddin Aulia, Aamir Khasrau, Nasiruddin Chiragh, Moinuddin Chishti and Jalaluddin etc, were all known for holding the Ulemas, orthodox Islamic scholars in high esteem. Khan further writes that though Nizamuddin Aulia and Moinuddin Chishti were among the most unorthodox when it came to music and dance, in the matters of Islam and Islamic supremacy, they held the words of the Ulema as sacrosanct. “What the Ulema seeks to achieve through speech, the Sufis achieve by behaviour,” Nizamuddin Aulia had said.The great Sufi saint Nasiruddin Chiragh had reportedly banned all practices that were deviant from the Sharia. Khan quotes Prof KA Nizami to describe what the Sufi leader Ghazzali had told in terms of Jihad, the Islamic religious war against Kafirs. Ghazzali had written that his followers must go on Jihad at least once a year and should bring down the fortresses of non-Muslims, they should cut down their throats drown them and burn their holy books. Jihadists may take whatever booty they desire. Toeing the orthodox line, Nizamuddin Aulia had condemned the Hindus of India to the ‘fires of hell’. He had also written that even if non-Muslims embrace Islam, the faith will not benefit them, because they had been unbelievers. He had added, “He, (Allah) has created paradise and hell for the believers and the infidels respectively to repay the wicked they (infidels) have done.” Now, coming to the specific comments in question about Moinuddin Chisti – one made during an interview with the Son of Hamas – Mosab Hassan Yousef. It is necessary to place on record that in the full video interview uploaded on YouTube, the mention of Moinuddin Chisti had long been redacted. Let me explain why. When I asked the question about Sufism and Hindus, I intended to talk about the campaign of certain Sufis against Hindus – which has been documented throughout history – even as recently as 1992. In the video description, I have explained that when I spoke of rape, I was referring to the Ajmer Dargah Rape scandal where hundreds of Hindu girls were raped with the active connivance and participation of the Khadims of Ajmer Dargah – the Chistis – who claim to be the descendants of Moinuddin Chisti. Farooq Chisti was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2007, but in 2013, the Rajasthan High Court deemed he had served ‘enough’ time and therefore, released him. The Ajmer Dargah still associates itself with him and his local clout has remained intact. Nafis Chist was absconding until 2003, before being caught by the Delhi Police while trying to escape, wearing a burqa. He is currently out on bail and respected in a similar way in Ajmer. These are facts. In the second part of the question, I spoke about cows being slaughtered and thrown into Hindu temples. I also spoke about the desecration of Hindu temples and the Jihad waged by Moinuddin Chisti – this assertion is again documented in history. Here is an excerpt from the book “Islamic Jihad” by MA Khan. Khan writes further that every day, Khwaja’s followers used to bring a cow and they used to slaughter it near a prominent temple where the local Raja and Hindus used to pray, cook kebabs from the cow’s meat to eat, just to show contempt towards the local Hindus. Chishti had come to India to fight Jihad on the side of the Sultan Muhammad Ghauri against the Hindu King Prithviraj Chauhan. Chishti had credited himself for Prithviraj’s capture, writing, “We have seized Pithaura (Prithviraj) and handed him to the army of Islam.” In addition, this is what a previous version of the website of Ajmer Dargah itself said and I quote, “When he had settled down in Ajmer, the Khawaja Sahib had a special reminder about his marriage through a ‘Basharat’ (prophetic dream) from the Holy prophet sometime in 590 AH or 1193 AD. The Prophet said, “O Moinuddin, You are a great preceptor of our religion. You should not depart from our ‘sunnah’ (meaning marriage which is incumbent upon every Muslim under the laws of Shariat). Coincidentally that very night Malik-a-Khitab devotee of Hazrat Khawaja Sahib, had captured a Raja’s daughter in an encounter who embraced Islam and Khawaja sahib, in response to the above reminder, married her giving her the Islamic name of Bibi Ummutulla..” Here is an archive link to the page: https://web.archive.org/web/20180319103851/http://dargahajmer.com/married-life/ This is also substantiated in A History Of Sufism in India, Sayyad Athar Abbas Rizvi, Vol 1, pg. 124. However, since the snippet in the video was not an explainer and merely a question, I realized it may be misinterpreted and therefore, the mention of the individual was removed. It bodes well, however, to repeat on record that I stand by the rest of my statement. Since the Islamists have been relentlessly demanding my arrest, I must place on record that if needed, I will be more than willing to defend my position in a court of law.It is said that the most effective way to destroy people is to deny and obliterate their own understanding of their history. For what little my contribution is worth, I refuse to be a part of that obliteration – I will not be silenced. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"10 December, 2023 ","Antisemitism is not new to US campuses including Ivy Leagues, their credibility is questionable for more reasons than one. Here’s why",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/antisemitism-not-new-to-us-campuses-their-credibility-questionable/,"While several academic institutes across America, both Ivy League and, public and private, saw a dramatic rise in hostility against Jewish students, these have turned out to be symptoms of an underlying disease.A mix of Georgian and Victorian-era inspired academic buildings are spread across the Northeastern United States. Besides the entitled exclusivity in the admissions process, the unreasonable fee structure and the decorated syllabus, there is also a sadistic appeal to the Gothic appearance these institutions boast of.But, to quote Shakespeare, all that glitters is not gold.The holier-than-thou attitude over the decades of US’s Ivy Leagues – touted as the world’s most esteemed and prestigious universities – was brought to its knees when presidents of two of the three universities, Harvard and Penn, and the third being the high-ranking MIT, refused to condemn calls for genocide of Jews at a congressional hearing on 5th December.On 5th December, a congressional hearing on “Holding Campus Leaders Accountable and Confronting Antisemitism” was held in Washington, D.C.At the hearing, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik confronted the Presidents of Harvard University, University of Pennsylvania and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).Her specific yes or no question to them was, “Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate your university’s rules or code of conduct regarding bullying or harassment?”MIT President Sally Kornbluth responded saying that “if targeted at individuals and not making public statements”. When asked for a yes or no answer, Kornbluth said that she has not heard calls for the genocide of Jews on MIT campus.The Congresswoman questioned, “But you have chants for intifada?” To this, Kornbluth replied, “I have heard chants which can be antisemitic depending on the context when calling for the elimination of the Jewish people.”She said that such calls would be investigated as harassment only “if pervasive and severe”.President (now former) of University of Pennsylvania, Liz Magill’s response came with wide smiles and smirks. She said, “If the speech turns into conduct it can be harassment, yes.”When questioned again, Magill said that if such speech is directed and severe and pervasive, it is harassment. When asked if she means a yes, Magill said it is a context-dependent decision.She maintained that “if the speech becomes conduct, it is harassment”. Magill finally responded with a yes after much struggle. President of Harvard, Dr Claudine Gay reiterated the same chorus in answer to the question.“It (the call for genocide of Jews) can be (violate rules) depending on the context,” Dr Gay said. When asked what the context is she said, “targeted as an individual, targeted at an individual.”“Antisemitic rhetoric when it crosses into conduct, it amounts to bullying, harassment, intimidation, that is actionable conduct and we do take action,” Dr Gay said.The roughly 3 minute 31 second long video of the hearing took social media by the storm prompting angry responses from netizens. The matter has escalated with key stakeholders demanding accountability from the presidents of the respective universities.President Liz Magill of University of Penn has resigned amid mounting pressure.The focus of the hearing by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce was the rise in cases of antisemitism reported on campuses across the US and the universities’ response to the same.This comes in the backdrop of the 7th October terrorist attack by Palestinian group Hamas on Israel killing at least 1,400 people and kidnapping more than 200 to Gaza. Israel has since vowed to avenge the death of its people and has launched an all-out offensive against the terrorist group.A selective support for Palestinians toeing the Hamas line has since mushroomed in campuses across the United States. In the name of human rights of Palestinians, the terrorist attack by Hamas on Israel has been justified on the campuses of these so-called prestigious institutions with absolutely no repercussions from the administration.On 11th October, four days after the brutal attack on Israel, a group of Harvard students submitted a letter in support of Palestine. This prompted several corporate institutions, particularly those with Jewish heads, warning Harvard that they will not hire students supporting Hamas. Several Jewish donors to the universities also threatened to withdraw their donations.On 25th October, Jewish students at Cooper Union college in New York had to be locked inside library for their own safety as pro-Palestinian students tried to break down the door chanting “Free Palestine”. The Jewish students had to be escorted out through tunnels using the back door.On 18th October, a “Stop the genocide in Gaza” die-in demonstration was reportedly organised by the Harvard Business School. A video from the demonstration showed a Jewish student mobbed by pro-Palestinian demonstrators screaming “shame, shame, shame”.On 24th October, an antisemitic slogan was displayed on the wall of the library of George Washington University. It read, “Free Palestine From The River To The Sea.” Another message read, “Glory to our martyrs” and one read, “End the siege on Gaza”.While several academic institutes across America, both Ivy League and, public and private, saw a dramatic rise in hostility against Jewish students, these have turned out to be symptoms of an underlying disease.A complaint letter via e-mail by the Jewish rights group ‘Brandeis Center’ to the University of Pennsylvania alleged that the latter had allowed its campus to become a hostile environment for Jewish students and a magnet for antisemites.It pointed to a festival that was organised by the university titled “Palestine Writes Festival” which hosted antisemitic speakers. Notably, this festival came days before the terrorist attacks proving the antisemitism is pre-existing sentiment on campuses in the US.The letter read, “In the days leading up to the September Festival, anti-Semitic graffiti and a Penn student’s violent attack on Penn’s Hillel signaled trouble to come for Jewish students and institutions on campus.”Surprisingly, the festival was organised on the same day as the Jewish festival ‘Jewish High Holy Days of Awe”. Meanwhile, Magill, despite concerns raised by several members, stood by the event citing “free speech”.Even now, as recently as 9th December (Saturday), Jewish students in the Penn University are being subjected to chants like “We are Hamas” whereas openly antisemitic professors and staff are still employed with the university.Forget even the recent decades, antisemitism on US campuses goes back nearly a century. In the 1950s, Stanford University reportedly tried to limit the proportion of its Jewish students.Stanford University is located on the West Coast of the US and is not an Ivy League university but ranks higher than Ivy League varsities.Another report reveals that the Seth Low Junior College (SLJC) near the Columbia University was “created with the explicit goal of reducing the amount of Jewish students on the CU campus”. It was built in the early 20th century.As per the report, the “enrollment of Jewish students at Columbia College after Seth Low Junior College’s opening dropped from 40 to 25 per cent”. Moreover, on one hand, half of the total Columbia College applicants were accepted, only one in six Jewish applicants were admitted in the early 20th century.This was reportedly the case in most East Coast schools in the US.One might think that on-campus antisemitism is an elephantine problem which dwarfs any other controversies surrounding academic campuses in America.Not really. The political invasion of campuses in America which is being exposed with hatred for Jews and Israel has only compounded their already declining credibility.The larger-than-life projected image of these institutions in the US has been a facade which has been maintained through endowments, donations and charities flowing in like dirt, open political biases, crippling admissions fees thereby giving academic access to only a handful, racial and gender persecution, and woke agendas.You’d be surprised, if not shocked, to know that it was only in June this year that the US Supreme Court ruled that universities can no longer determine race as grounds for admissions.Up till the US SC verdict, race was still very much a part of the admissions process in the United States centered around the idea of “positive discrimination”.And yet, the move was decried by the left-liberal media in the US as the end of “affirmative action”.Racism has been rampant, like a regular petty crime, on US campuses including the so-called esteemed campuses. This has only served to fan left wing politics in the US where voices are raised prominently when incidents involve a black victim.But when Asian or Indian students are subjected to racism, the same woke left wing crowd goes into hiding. Safe to say, US campuses are not merely dealing with crimes of unabated racism but several politicised versions of it.In 2020, Princeton University had acknowledged that systemic racism exists on its campus following which an investigation was launched by the Trump administration.Columbia University graduate Emma Sulkowicz made headlines in 2015 by staging a protest based on performance art against alleged sexual harassment.Sulkowicz walked around the campus carrying a 50-pound mattress and across the stage during her graduation to symbolise the weight carried around by victims of sexual assault.She had alleged that she was sexually assaulted by a classmate of rape during her sophomore year in 2013. The accused was cleared of the charges following a hearing by the university.In 2017, three professors in Dartmouth’s department of psychological and brain sciences were accused of sexual abuse and misconduct. The professors reportedly resigned or retired following recommendations for dismissal.However, the seven women who levelled the charges alleged that the college had failed to protect its students from sexual harassment and sexual assault.A scandal broke out in Cornell University last year exposing alleged incidents of sexual assault and druggings at off-campus fraternity parties. A crime alert was issued early in November 2022 by the campus police responding to four different reports of students being drugged and at least once case of sexual assault.In May 2022, a longtime professor at Princeton named Joshua Katz was suspended after investigation revealed that he had sex with one of his undergraduate students years ago.In 2021, several complaints surfaced against the professor from mid-2000s alleging disturbing cases of allegedly propositioning undergraduates for sexual relationships.In 1986, a shocking scandal was uncovered in Brown University wherein students were allegedly linked to a sex worker ring in Providence. Multiple students were charged with sex work crimes and drug possession.According to The Washington Post, Harvard in 2022 warned all undergraduate students that “cisheterosexism,” “fatphobia” and “using the wrong pronouns” amounted to “abuse” and perpetuated “violence” on campus.In May this year, the student government at the Northwestern University in Illinois “indefinitely” froze the funds of the College Republicans over an event poster showing conservative speaker James Lindsay, critical of transgenderism.After an uproar that has been dragging in the US over participation of trans athletes in women’s sports, a bill was approved by the House Republicans in April this year barring such transgender athletes whose biological sex awas assigned at birth as male from competing on girls’ or women’s sports teams.As if the use of a thousand pronouns for individually-preferred “gender” identification has not disadvantaged academically-focused students enough, transgenders participating against females in sports has most definitely put the latter at a physical disadvantage.High-profile names involving celebrities and politicians and their aides were at the center of a massive admissions scandal across universities.College athletics coaches and test administrators accepted bribes and donations in exchange for recruiting students. The mastermind, William Rick Singer, was paid a whopping $25 million by celebrity parents to bribe coaches and university administrators to designate their children as purported athletic recruits to facilitate their admission.Singer allegedly created fake charities to facilitate money for “donations” to various colleges including Yale University, Georgetown, Stanford and the University of Southern California.The big names involved in the scandal include Lori Loughlin, Felicity Huffman, Mossimo Giannulli, William H Macy, Michelle Janavs and many more. One of the more prominent names is Gordon Ernst, former Georgetown University tennis coach known for having coached the Obamas.In 2022, a professor at Columbia University, Michael Thaddeus, published a paper accusing the varsity of manipulating data to project that it spent more on research and instruction than it actually did.This, reportedly, in turn is suspected to have played a role in the Ivy League institution’s jump in the rankings. The university later admitted that they had reported incorrect data but refused to admit that it was done to improve rankings.As per the professor’s report, the varsity’s rankings moved up from no. 18 in 1988 to no 2 by 2022. Following the controversy, Columbia, Yale and Harvard announced that they would no longer participate in the rankings in the future.The rise of wokeism on university campuses in US can easily be attributed to left-wing bias. In fact, it can be considered a branch of the same tree.According to a poll, Republicans have the least amount of confidence (19%) in higher education in the United States whereas Democrats have the highest level of confidence at 59%.Another related survey reportedly found that 77% of college presidents in the US agree that the perception of colleges as intolerant of conservative views has impacted people’s attitudes about higher education.According to a report, US universities have been receiving funding from Qatar particularly in the period between 2001 and 2021, “precisely after the September 11 attacks”.As per the report based on a study published in 2022, a staggering $4.7 billion was injected into universities in the United States. Moreover, the recipients did not report part of the money received as required by the law.“Qatar has reportedly become the largest foreign donor to American academic in the two decades since 9/11,” the report reads.In 2020, the Trump administration alleged that top US universities have “massively underreported” foreign funding from China, Russia and other nations described as “foreign adversaries”.According to another report, Saudi Arabia owned oil company ARAMCO has been funding programmes in US universities like Princeton since as early as the 1950s. Moreover, Middle East studies programme in US institutions reportedly receive specifically from Arab countries to “advance their political agendas”.“I don’t think there’s any doubt that the Saudis have seen such donations as a way to acquire goodwill, legitimacy and support in U.S. academia,” the report quotes NYU professor Zachary Lockman. Interestingly, it must be noted that some of the biggest names like George Soros and the Rothschilds, which bestow donations in billions to the US acadmia, are Jewish. And it is thus a wonder as to how these institutions, funded equally well by the left-liberal globalist disruptors like their Middle Eastern counterparts, have been unable to counter antisemitism. Yet, when questions are raised against these conglomerates, they coin the term antisemitism through their rights groups and NGOs in their defence.All in all, Universities in the US are too good to be true for their realities have been exposed for all to see since a long time. It is time to stop trusting every colonial infrastructure just because they put on a good show of elitist exclusivity. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"7 December, 2023 ","How The Hindu consoled itself and shielded Rahul Gandhi after electoral drubbing in 3 states: Blaming regional leaders, voters, Hindutva and more",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/the-hindu-shields-rahul-gandhi-electoral-loss-3-states-regional-leaders-voters-hindutva/,"The Gandhi family must realise how faithful the editors and owners of The Hindu are towards them and make such great efforts to make them look good. The effort the writers at The Hindu put up in finding new phrases and words to describe their disgust towards the voters is praiseworthy! By now, we are all used to the Congress party leaders crediting the Gandhi family for victories and blaming the regional leaders for their defeats. It is understandable why they are forced to do this. However, it is baffling that certain newspapers, that claim to be brave, daring, unbiased and whatnot, also willingly resorted to this same argument. Just to shield the Gandhi family.The Congress party lost in Rajasthan (RJ), Madhya Pradesh (MP) and Chhattisgarh (CG) in the just concluded elections to these states. The Hindu, in a great show of loyalty towards the Gandhi family, asks us – Did overconfident regional leaders in the Hindi heartland pay no heed to Congress top brass?We are told by the author that in these three states, “heavyweights took independent decisions often ignoring the high command”. Are we to seriously believe there are people in Congress who are capable of ignoring the Gandhi family and making decisions? The author cites the example of Kamal Nath cancelling an I.N.D.I Alliance meeting in Bhopal. Are we to believe that Rahul Gandhi had no role in the cancellation of such a meeting? However, in my opinion, the best argument by the author was about the CG election. He writes that “Though the AICC did replace over 20 MLAs to beat anti-incumbency, Mr Baghel could not effectively counter the allegations of corruption against his government by the BJP”. Cute, no? The Gandhi family thought their job ended with replacing MLAs. The job of winning the narrative is on the CM only though. Imagine if Congress had won. The same author would have written how the Gandhi family played a master stroke by replacing 20 MLAs! This article is not the only place where The Hindu has given us pearls of wisdom. Their editorial on the results of these elections was even better! We have been told that the victory was because the BJP’s campaign was “laced with communal propaganda” and therefore “had a more effective outreach to subaltern segments”. I like the choice of phrase – subaltern segments. It’s a posh way of insulting the intelligence of the voters. In this particular case, The Hindu is arguing that the voter chose BJP’s communal agenda over Congress’s caste agenda. In its entire (long) editorial, The Hindu makes no mention of governance-based reasons on why the voters were vexed with Congress in RJ and CG where it was in power; and why they didn’t see Congress as an alternative in MP where BJP has been in power for nearly 2 decades now. We are told that Ashok Gehlot is so awesome that even though he lost the election he prevented a complete washout! And just in case you forgot that they told you that the BJP won because of Hindutva, they repeat it once again in their (long) editorial. This time, they accuse women, youth and tribal communities of falling prey to “Hindu identity politics”. I wonder what wrong the men did, to not get this honour! The editorial is severely upset that the caste census idea of Rahul Gandhi did not resonate with the voters. The editorial takes up a lot of space and conveys very little. When you separate the wheat from the chaff, it is baffling how The Hindu always ends up arguing that BJP’s victories are always because of Hindutva and nothing else really matters. How they try to find solace in the performance of the Congress party is also very touching. Their front-page banner story also highlighted how despite losing, they had their vote share intact! I hope the Gandhi family realises how faithful the editors and owners of The Hindu are towards them and make such great efforts to make them look good. The effort the writers at The Hindu put up in finding new phrases and words to describe their disgust towards the voters is really praiseworthy! They have been resorting to the same argument ever since the 2014 Lok Sabha victory changed the political landscape of India. It’s been more than 9 years, but they are yet to get out of the shock! Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"6 December, 2023 ",31 years of Babri demolition: Remembering the Karsevaks who razed the face of adharma to the ground to pave the way for a Bhavya...,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/babri-demolition-by-karsevaks-paved-the-way-for-ram-mandir-temple-in-ayodhya/,"While centuries of struggle to reclaim Dharma culminated in November 2019 when the Supreme Court of India handed over the encroached land in Ayodhya to Hindus, paving the way for the construction of a Bhavya Ram Mandir, the events that transpired on 6 December 1992 hold profound significance, for it manifested in the starkest form the passions and devotion of Karsevaks in wanting to liberate the birthplace of Lord Rama. Saryu Mata (the Holy river in Ayodhya) bears witness to the events and incidents of Ramayana in the Treta Yug to the reclamation of the Bhavya Ram Mandir in Ayodhya in the present day. She was the source for Bhagwan Ram, a reincarnation of Bhagwan Vishnu, and his devotees in Ayodhya to return to Vishnu Ji’s abode Vaikunth Dham.On 2nd November 1990, once again, albeit in shocking circumstances, the souls of Shri Ram’s devotees departed for Vaikunth right from the banks of Saryu. The Mulayam Singh-led UP Police had opened fire on a large group of kar sevaks who had come to Ayodhya to demand that the Babri structure be demolished and Ram Mandir be reconstructed.The Kothari brothers – Ram (23) and Sharad (20) Kothari – were the first ones to mount a Saffron flag atop the Babri controversial structure. A report filed on 3rd November 1990 in Jansatta said that an unidentified kar sevak from Sriganganagar, Rajasthan fell after being shot and as he fell, he wrote “Sitaram” on the road with his blood.It remains a mystery whether the Karsevak had written his name or was his devotion and adherence towards Lord Ram that made him write “Sitaram” in his own blood.The report mentioned that even after Karsevak fell to the ground, the CRPF personnel shot seven bullets into his skull.As per official figures, 16 kar sevaks were killed in cold blood. But actual numbers are believed to be much higher. Their only crime was that they staged peaceful demonstrations by expressing their religious reverence and singing bhajans.Little did they know that their act would send a wave across the country that would come right back to hit that very spot on 6th December 1992 for nothing and no one could soil the spirit of Ram Bhakts. 25 months later, on 6th December 1992, Hindus reminded the world once again that they hadn’t remotely been deterred in their fight for divine justice.The Vishwa Hindu Parishad organised a kar seva in Ayodhya in 1992 and an area was marked for worship on 6th December. Kar sevaks from across the country began to pour into Ayodhya in large numbers even as security personnel were deployed in equally large numbers.According to Mahant Brajmohan Das, who witnessed the demolition of the Babri structure on 6th December 1992, the birthplace of Shri Ram was filled with joy and enthusiasm. “Only those who were present in Ayodhya on that day can explain what God’s miracles and powers are,” he said.All arrangements including food, accommodation et cetera were made for thousands of devotees. “There seemed to be complete Ram Rajya in Ayodhya,” he said. Despite what ensued in 1990, the number of karsevaks visiting Ayodhya in 1992 and security personnel deployed was so large that the Mahant said that if the massacre was repeated, no one would come out alive.Finally, on 6th December 1992, a kar sevak entered an empty bus belonging to the security forces near Hanumangarhi and raced it towards the Babri structure shattering all barricades and paving the way for kar sevaks who followed.Call it divine intervention, the symbol of tyranny, savagery and bigotry was razed to dust that day; this formed the cornerstone of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. Kar sevaks cut the barbed wire barricading the Babri structure and climbed atop it.The three worn-out tombs of the Babri structure were brought down in less than 6 hours amid Holy chants of Shri Ram Jai Ram Jai Jai Ram. This was the first line of treatment for the wounded Hindu civilisation, all thanks and namans (bowing down) to the kar sevaks who risked their lives once again.Documentaries were made by the mainstream media to blot the image of kar sevaks, nat up sounds of Jai Shri Ram were played by the ecosystem of the day to push a narrative to demonise the Holy chant.Even as the Hindus, the kar sevaks removed the Babri structure from the face of the earth – as should be the case with every symbol of adharma (roughly translating to injustice) – we paid the price for it in the war of narratives that were to come.Hindus displayed to the world that when justice is delayed and denied when a civilisation seeking justice is brutalised and demonised, we will come to our own defence.Come to think of it, our patience knows no bounds but when we are pushed to the edge and tested, we end adharma once and for all – be it slaying Ravan in Treta Yug, demolishing Babur’s Babri structure in 1992 or bulldozing the mafia to the ground today.31 years on, every year on this day a certain ecosystem mourns the physical death of Babri structure while the civilisational wounds of a devout Hindu continue to be healed. On 22nd January 2024, Ram Lalla’s Pran Pratishtha will be performed and He will finally be resting comfortably watching over us from His Bhavya Mandir.On 6th December 2023, we must remember and celebrate the men and women across the nation who enabled this movement and reignited hope in Hindus. They taught us that bullets and barricades can’t kill our souls. We must dare to demolish injustice to the ground every time it pops its ugly face and pave the way for justice.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"16 December, 2023 ",PM Modi’s degree case: Gujarat court junks Kejriwal’s plea against nod to prosecute him in defamation complaint filed by Gujarat University,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/gujarat-court-junks-kejriwals-plea-against-prosecution-in-defamation-case-filed-by-gujarat-university/,"The court of additional chief metropolitan magistrate SJ Panchal rejected Arvind Kejriwal's plea, noting that no such sanction was required. On Friday (15th December), a metropolitan court in Gujarat rejected Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s plea opposing criminal prosecution in the defamation complaint filed by Gujarat University. The metropolitan court observed that there is no need for prior approval for his trial in this case, as the remarks made by the politician do not seem to have been made as part of the discharge of official duty.Notably, AAP National Convener Arvind Kejriwal and AAP Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh are facing trial in connection with a criminal defamation complaint filed by the registrar of Gujarat University Piyush Patel. The complaint pertains to their “sarcastic” and “derogatory” statements made in connection with PM Modi’s educational degree.Citing provisions of Section 197 of the CrPC, Kejriwal had sought protection asserting that a sanction was required to initiate a trial against him because he is a public servant.However, the court of additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate SJ Panchal rejected his plea, noting that no such sanction was required. The matter will now be heard on the next date set on 28th December.Earlier on 13th December, the AAP Supremo had filed an application before Panchal’s court. In his plea, the AAP leader challenged his prosecution in the matter as he is a public servant. His advocates had argued that since there was no permission from the proper authority to start a criminal case against him, the trial was not valid. They claimed that the comments were made as part of a public servant’s duty to ask questions.Gujarat University’s counsel Amit Nair opposed the application and asserted that Kejriwal made defamatory statements about the university and tarnished the image of the institution. He submitted that utterance of defamatory words does not fall under the category of discharge on official function and hence, such a sanction was not required in the present case. Additionally, on 13th December, magistrate Panchal had also rejected Kejriwal and co-accused Sanjay Singh’s applications that sought adjournment of proceedings in the defamation case. The court observed that prima facie there appeared to be a case against them under section 500 (defamation) of the Indian Penal Code(IPC) and had summoned the duo. The case against the AAP leaders was filed by GU registrar Piyush Patel following their comments, which came in response to the Gujarat High Court overturning the Chief Information Commissioner’s order regarding the PM’s degree.The complainant asserted that the AAP leaders made “defamatory” statements in press conferences and on their Twitter(now X), handles targeting the university over Modi’s degree. He said that their comments targeting Gujarat University were defamatory and hurt the prestige of the educational institution which has established its name among members of the public. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"15 December, 2023 ","‘We are committed to bringing UCC and implementing CAA’, says Union Home Minister Amit Shah",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/we-are-committed-to-bringing-ucc-and-implementing-caa-says-home-minister-amit-shah/,"Amit Shah said, ""Congress party kept it aside due to its vote bank politics. However, the constituent assembly consisted of a majority of Congress leaders only. There were the topmost Congress leaders in the constituent assembly. They only have made this provision. But it is the BJP that has been consistently following it up because a common law for citizens from all religions is the prime feature of any state that calls itself to be secular.""On (Thursday) 14th December, Union Home Minister Amit Shah attended the program Agenda Aaj Tak. In the interview he gave to Rahul Kanwal in this program, he said that the BJP government is committed to bringing the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) and implementing the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). Amit Shah said that CAA is the law of the country and it will certainly be implemented.Rahul Kanwal asked Amit Shah when a nationwide Uniform Civil code was on the agenda of the Bharatiya Janata Party and why it is implementing the law state by state. Amit Shah said, “You need not present the UCC in front of the people of India as if it is only an agenda of the Bharatiya Janata Party. UCC was a mandate given by the constituent assembly to the executive pillar of the country and the parliament. In the directive principles of the state policy in Article 44 of the constitution of India, our constituent assembly had mentioned a few things that it could not implement immediately after independence. Those things are covered in the directive principles of the state policy in Article 44 of the constitution of India. And the Uniform Civil Code is one of those things.”हम UCC लाने के लिए अडिग हैं… pic.twitter.com/i69uYvaTdqHe added, “It is a whole different story that the Congress party kept it aside due to its vote bank politics. However, the constituent assembly consisted of a majority of Congress leaders only. There were the topmost Congress leaders in the constituent assembly. They only have made this provision. But it is the Bharatiya Janata Party that has been consistently following it up because a common law for citizens from all religions is the prime feature of any state that calls itself to be secular. But the Congress forgot this thing. It painted this issue in a different ideological colour due to its vote bank politics. The Bharatiya Janata Party does not believe in such things.”Amit Shah said, “Right from 1950 (the Bharatiya Jan Sangh days), our election manifestos include the promise that we will try our best to bring the UCC. Now, you have said that we are bringing it state by state. The Common Civil Code is a huge social and legal change. Everyone’s opinion is needed for it. If one, two, or three states do it, if committees are formed, hearings are done, lakhs of people are heard, and their opinions are taken, then it forms a basis to form the law. Its legal scrutiny is also possible. And I believe that the mature output of this process will automatically be accepted by the whole country. The Bharatiya Janata Party under the leadership of Narendra Modi is committed to bringing the UCC. We will not back out on this issue anywhere.”About the Citizenship Amendment Act, Amit Shah said, “CAA is the law of the country. It is an instrument to do justice to our brothers and sisters from the Hindu faith and the other 6 religious minorities who were persecuted in Pakistan, Bangladesh, and other countries mentioned. I want to assure the people of the country that the CAA is the law of the country and it will certainly be implemented. CAA will not take away anybody’s citizenship.”CAA देश का कानून है और उसका लागू होना तय है। pic.twitter.com/3lBUhdXREqAmit Shah added, “A false propaganda was peddled among the minorities and especially the Muslims in India that the CAA would take away their citizenship. No one’s citizenship is cancelled by the CAA. The CAA is not the law to take away anyone’s citizenship. It is a law that gives citizenship. It will be implemented. You will get to know when it will be implemented. You need not worry. It will be implemented at a proper time and it is a certain thing.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

He condemned the incident and denied the claims in various media reports that the farmer unions would protest to get the parliament security breach case accused Neelam Singh released. Neelam Singh is one of the 7 accused arrested so far in this case.

These claims surfaced in various media reports because Azad Palwa, a member of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha and a farmer leader, also visited Neelam Singh’s house. He demanded Neelam Singh’s release and said he would also call a meeting of the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha on the next day (14th December) in this regard. He said that if Neelam is not released soon, then a big step will be taken.In his video statement, Rakesh Tikait said on 14th December, “The incident that took place in the parliament on 13th December wherein the security breach took place and some persons entered there.

These claims can be someone’s personal opinion or statement that ‘if they are not released, SKM will protest’. It can be his statement. This is not an authentic statement of any of the SKM leaders.”There were also some media reports that Neelam’s mother has claimed that if she is not released soon tne BKU will march to Delhi.#NeelamAzad की माँ ने दावा किया है कि भारतीय किसान यूनियन ने कहा है कि अगर पुलिस ने नीलम को नहीं छोड़ा तो किसान संगठन दिल्ली की तरफ कूच करेंगे l लेकिन #राकेश_टिकैत ने साफ कहा कि किसान संगठनों ने ऐसा कोई निर्णय नहीं लिया है l pic.twitter.com/BLuASvsLaXHe added, “Whatever we decide, we take that decision in our meeting only. Whenever we will hold a meeting, we will give our clarification in this regard there only. This is not our statement. Whatever these youths have done, it is their decision. It is about their personal ideology. BKU and SKM have nothing to do with it.”On Thursday, 14th December, a Mahapanchayat was organized in Haryana’s Jind, where local leaders demanded the release of Neelam Singh.

"15 December, 2023 ","SC to hear Mahua Moitra’s challenge to expulsion a day after CJI Chandrachud asked her to email her plea for urgent hearing, promised to...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/sc-to-hear-mahua-moitras-plea-challenging-expulsionfrom-lok-sabha/,"On Wednesday (13th December), the Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud assured Trinamool Congress Party (TMC) leader Mahua Moitra that he would look into the listing of her plea against her expulsion from Lok Sabha in a cash-for-query case. The Supreme Court will on Friday (15th December) hear TMC leader Mahua Moitra’s plea challenging her expulsion as Lok Sabha MP in the cash-for-query case. On Wednesday, Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for Moitra, mentioned before a bench headed by CJI the plea of Moitra for urgent listing.This comes two days after the Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud on Wednesday (13th December) assured Trinamool Congress Party (TMC) leader Mahua Moitra that he would look into the listing of her plea against her expulsion from Lok Sabha in a cash-for-query case. CJI had assured the senior advocate that he would look into the listing aspect at lunch during the day. “The matter may not have been registered… If an email was sent, then I would look at it right away. Please send it,” the CJI said. Moitra was expelled from the House on 8th December following a discussion on the report submitted by the Ethics Committee which was tabled in the House.The report based on the probe on “unethical conduct” of the TMC MP had recommended that Moitra be expelled from the Lok Sabha and called for an “intense, legal, institutional inquiry” by the central government in a “time-bound manner”.As per the report, Moitra visited the United Arab Emirates four times from 2019 to 2023 from where her Parliament login was accessed several times.As per sources, the Committee noted that Moitra’s actions left “irrepressible impact on the national security.” It had noted that the TMC leader’s conduct is unbecoming of a member of Parliament.Moitra had accepted expensive luxury items as gifts and illegal gratification from a businessman to further his interests. The businessmen allegedly used her Parliamentary login to list questions against Adani.A CBI is probing allegations of corruption and bribery where she has herself admitted that she had given her login credentials to businessman Darshan Hiranandani to pose questions on her behalf.The questions were related to Hiranandani’s business interests and were targeted at his rival Adani Group. Hiranandani has admitted to paying cash, lavish gifts to Moitra, and having access to her Lok Sabha login credentials.Reacting to her expulsion, Moitra said the expulsion was equal to a hanging by a “kangaroo court”.

"14 December, 2023 ","“Congress secured 10 lakh more votes than BJP in 4 states,” AAP MP Raghav Chadha, also a CA, gives bizarre logic, claims BJP will...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/aap-mp-raghav-chadha-says-congress-got-more-votes-than-bjp-despite-losing-in-3-states/,"Using a futile logic, Chadha compared the 2019 Lok Sabha election results to the 2023 assembly elections to say that the voteshare of the INDI Alliance parties has increased in the assembly polls as compared to in 2019.AAP MP Raghav Chadha tried to be a pollster to his own detriment. His analysis of the recently-concluded assembly elections in five states has prompted satirical response from netizens.During an interview with a news channel at their annual event, Raghav Chadha explained his logic to claim that the BJP despite winning in three states did not get the maximum votes but Congress, which won in one state, did.A clip from the interview is going viral where Raghav Chadha says that of the 11 crore people who cast their votes in the four states, 4 crore 80 lakh votes were with BJP and 4 crore 90 lakh votes were with Congress. He claimed that this means that Congress secured 10 lakh more votes than the BJP.Explaining the same, he said, “The five election states in total have 84 seats in the Lok Sabha of which BJP has 65 seats. But if you extrapolate the votes in the assembly election to Lok Sabha seats, if the BJP gets the same number of votes in 2024 as it did in the assembly polls, then its Lok Sabha seats will drop from 65 to 50.”On 3rd December, the results of the elections in the states Telangana, Rajastha, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh were released and on 4th December the results for Mizoram were declared.BJP won in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and even Chhattisgarh whereas Congress won in Telangana. In Mizoram, the Zoram People’s Movement (ZPM) party stood victorious.When asked about the INDI Alliance and whether AAP and Congress will come together in Delhi and Punjab especially after the latter lost to the BJP in three states, the AAP MP said the alliance will take positive lessons from the assembly elections and move towards 2024.Again, using a futile logic, Chadha compared the 2019 Lok Sabha election results to the 2023 assembly elections to say that the voteshare of the INDI Alliance parties has increased in the assembly polls as compared to in 2019.“In 2019, Congress had 6 seats in 5 states. If the voteshare which they got in these assembly elections is repeated in 2024, they will rise by 22 seats and touch 28 seats,” he said. Anchor Rahul Kanwal appeared visibly annoyed at the same.Netizens are having a field day with Chadha’s replies. X user @theskindoctor wrote, If you defeat @raghav_chadha 6-4, 1-6, 7-5 in a friendly tennis match, instead of accepting the defeat, Raghav will start claiming the victory by stating that he won more games (4+6+5 = 15) than you (6+1+7 = 14) in all three sets combined, and that’s why he’ll take the cup home.”If you defeat @raghav_chadha 6-4, 1-6, 7-5 in a friendly tennis match, instead of accepting the defeat, Raghav will start claiming the victory by stating that he won more games (4+6+5 = 15) than you (6+1+7 = 14) in all three sets combined, and that's why he'll take the cup home. pic.twitter.com/WoyooPSkmrAnother user Rosy said, “Chartered Accountant turned Neta turned Bollywood Damad Raghav Chadha’s Logic.”Chartered Accountant turned Neta turned Bollywood Damad Raghav Chadha's Logic 😂😂😂 #RaghavChadha pic.twitter.com/e4at9rIzbzIn another clip from the same interview, the AAP MP said that if Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh and Satyendra Jain agree to join the BJP , they will all come out of jail and become Union ministers and might get Bharat Ratna too.Today if Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and Satyendra Jain agree to join the BJP, they all will come out of jail and become central ministers and might even get Bharat Ratna too: Raghav Chadha pic.twitter.com/zUROEC4aYFWhile Manish Sisodia and Sanjay Singh are in jail in the Delhi liquor scam case, Satyendar Jain is also accused in a money laundering case.Meanwhile, the Aam Aadmi Party failed to win even a single seat in the states of Rajasthan, MP and Chhattisgarh where it had fielded its candidates.

"14 December, 2023 ","Modi Sarkar set to make a comeback in 2024 Lok Sabha elections with a thumping majority, predicts Times Now-ETG survey",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/etg-surveys-says-modi-government-will-make-a-comeback-in-2024-lok-sabha-polls/,"The survey forecasted a dominant performance by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The saffron party alone might clinch approximately 308-328 seats in the Lok Sabha Elections next year. On 13th December, Times Now and ETG Research published the results of an opinion survey for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The survey results indicated that the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is poised to make a historic return for the third consecutive term with an estimated 323 seats. The I.N.D.I. Alliance is expected to be overshadowed by the unmatchable popularity of PM Modi among the masses across the country, as per the survey conducted by ETG Research, I.N.D.I. Alliance may get around 163 seats in the general elections.The survey forecasted a dominant performance by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The saffron party alone might clinch approximately 308-328 seats in the Lok Sabha Elections next year. On the contrary, Congress is not looking good regarding seats and may have to satisfy its ‘grand old ego’ with 52 to 72 seats. Interestingly, the survey showed that despite the collaborative efforts of 18 opposition parties coming together as The Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (I.N.D.I.A.) to challenge PM Modi-led central government, the current ruling party is set to make a comeback with thumping numbers. According to the survey, the Alliance would not dent the popularity of PM Modi in Lok Sabha Elections.Notably, the survey has shown that NDA may lose some seats compared to the 2019 tally, but the number is more than enough to bring the saffron party back into the house with a stronghold on most seats. In the 2019 Lok Sabha Elections, the BJP-led NDA secured 353 seats. BJP alone crossed the 300 mark (303 seats), making it the highest number of seats any non-Congress seat guaranteed in the General elections. On the contrary, Congress managed to secure only 52 seats.The survey drew parallels between the upcoming Lok Sabha elections 2024 and recently conducted Assembly elections in five states, three of which were dominated by BJP. It is expected that the BJP will continue its dominance in the Hindi belt in the 2024 General Elections, especially in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. These states add 134 seats in the kitty. Interestingly, NDA/BJP won 117 seats out of 134 in these three states in 2019, while in 2014, NDA/BJP secured 123 seats. The results are expected to be similar in the upcoming general elections.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has played a vital role in the victories in the 2014 and 2019 General elections and recent Assembly Elections. Notably, in the Assembly Elections in Rajasthan, MP and Chhattisgarh, PM’s “Modi Ki Guarantee” campaign worked very well.The political landscape in the country is ever-changing, and such surveys provide a better understanding of the ground reality. The opposition parties under the banner of I.N.D.I. Alliance has not decided who is going to be their prime minister candidate. On the other hand, the BJP has already stated that the 2024 elections will be fought under the leadership of PM Modi. As many leaders in the opposition alliance would like to be the PM, like Rahul Gandhi, Mamata Banerjee, Nitish Kumar and, of course, Arvind Kejriwal, it is going to be difficult for them to finalise a common name. There is a good chance that the Alliance will break down at the time of seat division itself.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"14 December, 2023 ",Ex J&K Governor Satyapal Malik takes credit for abrogation of Article 370 months after claiming he had no idea about the Centre’s decision,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/satyapal-malik-claims-credit-forarticle-370-abrogation/,"Malik parroted the achievements that the Centre has been listing since the abrogation of Article 370. Satypal Malik is turning tables albeit on himself. In a recent interview with a leftist portal, the former Governor of Jammu and Kashmir has claimed credit for the abrogation of Article 370. This comes exactly eight months after his controversial interview with The Wire wherein he claimed that the Centre had not informed him about its decision to revoke Article 370.In his 17-minute 54-second long interview with “The Red Mike”, Satyapal Malik welcomes the Supreme Court’s decision upholding the abrogation of Article 370. He said, “I welcome the order because the abrogation of Article 370 began with my letter. And I have been proven right. There will be no debate on it now with the Supreme Court’s stamp.”When asked whether he was given any cue that Article 370 will be revoked at the time he was made the Governor of J&K, Malik said he wasn’t told any such thing. “But I had an idea that they will revoke it but because their election manifestos used to mention the same, I had suspected that they might revoke it during my tenure,” he said.In his interview with The Wire, he said that he had no information that such a decision is being made. Ironically, in a conversation with Rahul Gandhi in October, Malik had said that Article 370 did not hurt the people of J&K as much as making J&K a Union Territory has.In the latest interview, Malik said that PM Modi’s brief when he was made Governor was “no poliking, development and reach out”.After claiming the credit, Malik parroted the achievements that the Centre has been listing since the abrogation of Article 370. He was, however, quick to criticise the Centre when the anchor tried to downplay the development done in J&K.Malik said, “You are right that the development that should have happened has not happened. But until the Centre is interested, it will not happen. They should set up industries. Although AIIMS and such have been developed but nothing significant has been done in the area of industrial development.”He reminisced his days as Governor and when asked about the premature end to his tenure, Malik said that there was no political reason behind the same. “Since statehood was withdrawn and J&K was made a UT, my post would have to be downgraded to Leitenant Governor which I was not ready for,” Malik said.Again, in his conversation with Rahul Gandhi in October, Malik was rather critical about just how many times he was transferred by the Central government. “Meghlaya was my punishment posting after Goa,” he said with a smirk adding that he was transferred five times like a bureaucrat.Continuing the streak of credit-claiming with “The Red Mike”, Malik said that the people of Kashmir had understood the message of peace he had given to them which, he implied, is why peace prevailed in the valley even after the abrogation.When asked if he thinks the situation would have been better today had he decided to stay in J&K (as L-G), Malik said, “100 per cent it would have been better because I never gave them a chance to complain.”He further said that all other parties except for the BJP will be able to do well in the elections which the SC has directed to be held before 30 September 2024.Malik also said that Delhi (Central government) did injustice to the people of Kashmir by removing their elected representatives like Yasin Malik, who is a convicted terrorist and serving life imprisonment in Tihar jail for terror funding in Kashmir.Malik accused the Centre of tampering with the election results of terrorist Yasin Malik. He went on to say that he was not provided any security during and after SC’s verdict because the government wants him dead to prevent him from speaking.When milked by the anchor that the government does not credit him with the abrogation of Article 370, Malik said that the people give him credit wherever he goes.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"14 December, 2023 ","News24 posts misleading tweet on Muslim sculptors making idol of Ram Lalla, here are the facts on the idols being made for the Ram...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/news24-posts-misleading-tweet-on-muslim-sculptors-making-idol-of-ram-lalla/,"While Muslim sculptor Jamaluddin and his son are making fibre statues of Lord Ram for decorative purposes, News24 claimed they are making Ram Lalla idol to be placed in Ram MandirAs the date for grand opening of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya approaches, various updates about the temple are being reported by the media. However, misleading and fake news are also being published by some media houses regarding the Ram Mandir. One such false information was provided by News24, which claimed that the idol of Ram Lalla to be installed in the temple is being made by a Muslim sculptor and his son.On 14th December, News24 posted a tweet on X, claiming that Muhammad Jamaluddin from West Bengal and his son Bittu are sculpting the idol of Ram Lalla, which will take its place in the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. The tweet in Hindi said, “Ramlalla is ready to sit in the Ram temple of Ayodhya in January.” After that, the media houses added four bullet points, the first of which said, “The idols were made by Mohammad Jamaluddin of Bengal and his son Bittu.”News24 then said in the post that father-son duo has been crafting idols for a long time. The post then added remarks by Jamaluddin, who said, ‘Religion is a personal thing. People following many religions live in our country. The culture of brotherhood is my message as an artiste.’By saying that Jamaluddin and his son are making the idol of Ram Lall to be placed in Ram Mandir, News24 implied that the Muslim duo is making the main idol to placed in the sanctum sanctorum of the temple. But this is completely fake and misleading claim, and no Muslim is making the main idol of Ram Lalla.In fact, other media reports on Jamaluddin make it clear that he is making a decorating idol using fibre for the opening ceremony of Ram Mandir. As per a report by India Today, Mohammed Jamaluddin and his son Bittu have been engaged in creating some statues that will adorn the temple complex. The report stated that he is making life-size fibre statues.Other reports make it clear that the fibre statutes of Lord Ram and other Gods will be used to decorate the temple complex and the Ayodhya City during the inauguration ceremony. TV9 reported that statues of Lord Ram will be placed in major intersections in Ayodhya, and some of these idols are being made by Jamaluddin and his son.After several social media users pointed out the misleading claim made by News24, the media house later deleted the tweet.Fibre idols are generally used for decorative purposes, and they are not used as the main deity in temples. Most deities in Hindu temples are made from various types of stones, while temporary idols made for annual festivals are made using clay. Fibre idols last longer than clay, but are much easier to make compared to carving stone. Fibre idols are generally made for export, as they are lighter and easy to transport with the risk of damage. Notably, not one but three idols of Ram Lalla are being made in Ayodhya by three separate artists, and one of them will be picked by a committee to be placed in Sanctum Santorum, after which the pran pratistha rituals will be conducted by priests. Champat Rai, general secretary of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Trust, had earlier informed that the three different idols are being made by three sculptors – Ganesh Bhatt and Arun Yogiraj from Karnataka and Satyanarayan Pandey from Jaipur. Two of the idols are being made using two stones from Karnataka and one from Rajasthan. Earlier, a stone was brought from Nepal, and later stones were also brought from Odisha and Maharashtra to carve the idol, but those were found not suitable.Ganesh Bhatt of Karnataka is carving out the idol from Nellikaru rock or black stones which is also known as Shyam shila or Krishna shila. Famous sculptor Arun Yogiraj of Mysore, who sculpted the 12-ft statue of Adi Shankaracharya unveiled by PM Modi in Kedarnath, is sculpting another idol using another rock from Karnataka. Satya Narayan Pandey of Rajasthan is carving the Ram Lalla idol from white Makrana marble stones. All three artists are chiselling the idols based on a sketch by renowned artist Vasudeo Kamath from Mumbai.The 51-inch-tall Ram Lalla depicts the child form of Lord Ram, same as the current smaller idol that was placed in the makeshift temple for over half a century. The idol will depict five-year-old Ram Lalla sitting on a lotus, carrying a bow in one hand and an arrow in the other. Many other symbols related to Lord Ram will carved on the statue.While one idol will be selected to be permanently placed in the sanctum sanctorum, the other two idols will be placed in prominent places inside the temple premises.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"22 November, 2023 ","No, Shakib Al Hasan wasn’t beaten up on his return to Bangladesh after the World Cup: Here’s the truth about the viral video",https://www.opindia.com/2023/11/shakib-al-hasan-wasnt-beaten-up-on-his-return-to-bangladesh-after-world-cup-truth-about-the-viral-video/,"An old video of Bangladeshi cricketer Shakib Al-Hasan being beaten up and shoved around is going viral on social media with the claim that the all-rounder had been pushed around on his return to Bangladesh after the World Cup. In the wake of Bangladesh’s poor performance in the World Cup 2023, a video of Shakib Al Hasan being pulled, and thrashed by a mob is going viral on the internet. It is being claimed that the Bangladeshi Captain Shakib was mobbed by angry Bangladeshi fans on his return to the country. The viral video was also shared by some media portals claiming that the Bangladeshi skipper was ‘brutally beaten’/ ‘assaulted’ after the team’s World Cup debacle.  Kalesh b/w Bangladeshi Fans and Shakib al hasan, when he returned to Bangladesh after poor World Cup campaign  pic.twitter.com/C7DQK93gAkThis happened to Shakib when he returned to Bangladesh after poor World Cup campaign Bangladeshi people are top tier ret@rds https://t.co/iFDogEkZCA pic.twitter.com/xKkkyfmLFRJournalist Anil Tiwari who writes for Qatari mouthpiece Aljazeera, as per his Twitter bio, tweeted, “Bangladeshi fans assaulted their captain Shakib Al Hasan. Just yesterday, they were celebrating India’s defeat. Utterly disgraceful behaviour.”Bangladeshi fans assaulted their captain Shakib Al Hasan. Just yesterday, they were celebrating India's defeat. Utterly disgraceful behavior. #CricketWorldCup #Cricket #Bangladesh  pic.twitter.com/bYY9Cn6xBSHere are some headlines from media portals making those claims alongside sharing the viral video. A Cricket portal named OneCricket headlined (Archive) “[Watch] Shakib Al Hasan Gets ‘Brutally Beaten’ By Bangladesh Fans After Horrific World Cup Run”Notably, Bangladesh performed badly and finished in the eighth spot in the recently concluded World Cup, falling way below the fans’ expectations. The Shakib Al Hasan-led side only managed to win 2 games and the skipper himself had an unforgettable outing. He had to bench himself in some games due to injury concerns. However, the claims being made on the basis of the viral videos are fake. The video doing rounds on the internet is an old video. The said incident involving Shakib Al Hasan captured in the video took place in March this year, that is the video is 8 months old. It is not linked with Bangladesh’s poor performance at the World Cup or Shakib’s below-per-performance. Additionally, the Bangladeshi skipper was not assaulted or mobbed on his return to the country after the team’s World Cup debacle, as claimed on the internet.  The incident took place in Dubai on 16th March when Shakib Al Hasan went for a commercial event at a Jewelry store. After his series against England in March this year, Shakib flew to Dubai to inaugurate a gold jewelry shop that was owned by Arav Khan. Khan is a Bangladeshi fugitive and wanted in the murder case of a police official.At the time of the incident, Shakib was surrounded by fans who went out of control and he tried to rush out. However, in the chaos, he almost fell over while fans kept pulling his collar to stop him and take selfies with him. As seen from the video and confirmed by media reports of that time, he had no security around him to keep fans in check.   Regarding the Dubai incident involving Shakib, the Additional commissioner (detective) of Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) told the media that the man (Robiul Islam) who uploaded the video is from Bangladesh. The Police official added that Islam had murdered a police officer and had taken an Indian passport. He noted that the accused then went on to live in Dubai and despite knowing his criminal past Shakib went to his event. It is important to note here that Arav Khan’s original name is Robiul Islam. He hails from Kotalipara in Gopalganj and fled the country after charges of murder.The officer added that as part of the investigation, the Bangladeshi Cricket team’s captain might also be quizzed. Sharing reports and details of the original incident, several Twitter users called out the fake claims being made about Shakib Al Hasan. The users slammed individuals and media outlets for peddling these false claims, particularly those who connected the recent setback for Bangladesh with an older video depicting fans pulling his shirt, falsely portraying it as a case of him being manhandled or assaulted while attempting to take a selfie. This footage from Dubai in purposes of business and the audio was taken from a tv DramaOld news pic.twitter.com/NTb3uviioDFAKE NEWS BUSTED !! #ShakibAlHasanhttps://t.co/W7lwtlO2TaI hope you recover from the hated of your own bitrthland.Fake voice alertThis is a 8 months old video from dubai.where he went for promotion and fans wanted to take it photo with him.Crowd went out of control.Such a disgusting thing that it is morphed by a Bangladeshi Kohli fan pic.twitter.com/89qzTQvfsfSome users accused that the fake claims were peddled by Kohli fans in Bangladesh.

"14 December, 2023 ",‘Parliament me toh apne hi log gaye hain’: Leftist journalist Anil Sinha supports the accused in parliament security breach case,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/parliament-me-toh-apne-hi-log-gaye-hain-leftist-journalist-anil-sinha-parliament-security-breach-case/,"By calling the parliament intruders 'Apne Hi Log', Anil Sinha essentially meant that they belonged to the same ideology as him. He also lauded them for raising the same issues in the parliament which he claimed he was discussing in the debates.On Wednesday (13th December), the leftist-liberal YouTube channel Satya Hindi discussed the BJP’s landslide victory in three states and the change of generation in the leadership of the BJP in the states. During this discussion, leftist journalist Anil Sinha supported the accused in the recent episode of a security breach in the parliament wherein two youths jumped into the house from the visitor’s gallery and released a yellow gas from the canisters. Anil Sinha said, “We don’t have any IT cell to give reactions on this. Had the names of people from minority communities come up in the recent incident (of parliament security breach), they would have sat with a panel to discuss it by now. They (BJP and its supporters) would have taken a march from Vijay Chowk saying that it is an attack on constitution and democracy. But now they are sitting quietly and presenting it differently. Had Congress defeated them, why would we sit here to discuss and debate? On the Doklam issue, Vishnu Som of NDTV has reported along with satellite pictures. He showed how China has settled colonies there. He expressed doubt that China may manipulate Bhutan against us. But they are saying that Bhutan is with us only. Even the situation in Laddakh and Arunachal Pradesh is the same. There is no debate on China’s infiltration. But you see one on the parliament security breach.”Anil Sinha said, “Parliament me toh apne hi log gaye hain (Those who intruded into the parliament are our men only.) It is just that they entered the parliament in a wrong way. That is their only mistake. But they had gone there to register the protest. They did not harm anybody. Did they? And they raised the same issues (as us). And outside the parliament, they just released the gas. But, how did they reach there in the first place? Even I have covered parliament. How did they enter there crossing layers of security? This just exposes the security system of the new parliament.”That part can be heard after 52 minutes in the above video. Communist Journalists:""Parliament mei toh apne hi log gaye hain""""Kisi ko nuksaan toh pahunchaya nhi""""Protest karne gaye the na bhai"" pic.twitter.com/p4cqSji6udBy calling the parliament intruders ‘Apne Hi Log’, Anil Sinha essentially meant that they belonged to the same ideology as him. He also lauded them for raising the same issues in the parliament which he claimed he was discussing in the debates.On the 22nd anniversary of the 2001 Parliament terror attack, a major security breach occurred when two intruders entered the Lok Sabha chamber from the visitor gallery during Zero Hour. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) ordered an inquiry into a Parliament security breach incident. Six accused have been arrested in this case so far. On Thursday, police sources said that the main conspirator in Wednesday’s Parliament security breach is someone else, as per the initial investigation. The accused had conducted a recce outside the parliament beforehand. Police sources mentioned that all accused were associated with a social media page ‘Bhagat Singh Fan Club.’ Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"12 December, 2023 ","Did Washington Post repeat Pakistani conspiracy theory about ‘Disinfo Lab’? Copy-paste journalism, reliance on lunatic who wanted Mamata Banerjee raped, claims about ‘SkinDoctor’",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/washington-post-disinfo-lab-article-on-pakistani-conspiracy-theory/,"Despite his questionable character and dwindling credibility, Aveek Sen's misleading tweets on 'Disinfo Lab' became the primary fodder for both 'Pakistani Defence' and 'The Washington Post'.A day after The Washington Post carried out a hit job on Indian OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) handle ‘Disinfo Lab’, it has come to light that some of the outlandish claims made by the American newspaper bear an uncanny resemblance to conspiracy theories peddled by a Pakistani website.In an attempt to de-legitimise ‘Disinfo Lab’, The Washington Post claimed on Sunday (10th December) that the OSINT handle is run by an Indian Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) officer named Lt. Col. Dibya Satpathy.Although it relied on word salad, insinuations, ‘source-based’ allegations and dubious ‘experts’, the American newspaper failed to provide any empirical evidence that could dispute any claims of ‘Disinfo Lab.’Interestingly, a large part of the purported ‘investigation’ by The Washington Post on the Indian OSINT handle appears to be based on conspiracy theories peddled by a website named ‘Pakistan Defence.’In an article titled ‘Disinfo Lab – A Disinformation Project of Indian RA&W’, published by the website in February 2022, a staff writer Amaa’n relied on outlandish claims made by ‘journalist’ Aveek Sen to draw links between ‘Disinfo Lab’ and Indian Intelligence.The ‘Pakistan Defence’ article made references to Lt. Colonel Dibya Satpathy, Ajayendra Tripathi, and BJP leader Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga – all of whom appear prominently in the propaganda piece of The Washington Post.The Pakistani website presented the accusations of Aveek Sen, an abusive troll, as the ‘gospel truth.’ In the tweet from 2013 that went viral, Aveek Sen was seen quoting TimesNow, saying that Mamata Banerjee had called the Barasat rapists ‘CPIM supporters’. To that, Aveek Sen had responded saying “Its high time these cpm supporters rape Mamata!”Prior to deleting his account, Aveek Sen had made several dergatory comments targeting women. A few of his archived misogynist tweets can be seen here – In several of his tweets, Aveek Sen was seen referring to women as ‘prostitutes.’Despite his questionable character and dwindling credibility, Sen’s misleading tweets on ‘Disinfo Lab’ became the primary fodder for both ‘Pakistani Defence’ and ‘The Washington Post’. Interestingly, he had also collaborated with the likes of propaganda outlets such as Newslaundry.“And the making of Indian fake disinfo lab, copying the famous eu disinfo lab that exposed hundreds and thousands of fake Indian websites (By author Aveek sen),” read a line from the article on ‘Pakistan Defence.’Coincidentally, a similar language is used in the report published by The Washington Post. “Another person, a former employee, said the Disinfo Lab named and modelled itself after groups such as the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab and the EU DisinfoLab, a Brussels-based nonprofit that researches disinformation targeting Europe,” it claimed.It claimed, “Some of the fronts, setup by Colonel Dibya Satpathy, per Aveek Sen’s revelation, include: Root N Wings Media, situated at B-3, Bali’s, Near BSES Office, Arya Samaj Mandir, Lajpat Nagar 2, Delhi. Flat A-20, Lajpat Nagar 3, near Ring Road, Delhi.”Interestingly, the claims made it to the report of The Washington Post as well. “The Disinfo Lab, which at one point consisted of about a dozen private contractors working out of a four-story whitewashed building on a leafy street in New Delhi,” the leftist newspaper wrote.In another paragraph, it said, “The office operated under the name Root and Wings Media.” Based on Aveek Sen’s tweets, the shady Pakistani website alleged that Lt. Colonel Dibya Satpathy had been campaigning against the country on the behest of R&AW and BJP.OpIndia found yet another uncanny resemblance in the report of The Washington Post where it said, “The Disinfo Lab itself was headed by Satpathy, whose work has focused mostly on countering Pakistan.”“The Disinfo Lab’s activities show how the online propaganda campaigns waged by the BJP and its allies have been expanding beyond their traditional, domestic aims of shoring up popular support and denigrating opposition parties — and now seek to influence attitudes far beyond India’s borders,” the American newspaper claimed in another part of the article.Both The Washington Post and ‘Pakistan Defence’ made specific references to ‘Root Wings Media’ and characterised it as a ‘social media marketing company/ campaign agency.’“The company has no more than ten employees, typical of an intelligence front,” the Pakistani website said. And this is what the American newspaper claimed – “The Disinfo Lab, which at one point consisted of about a dozen private contractors.” Both The Washingon Post and ‘Pakistan Defence’ targeted targeted the ‘Disinfo Lab’ for exposing the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) and its biased reporting on India, which is often used to cast aspersions on Indian democracy.“Some of the investigative reports published by this website include one aiming to discredit the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom,” wrote ‘Pakistan Defence.’“The Disinfo Lab often cites publicly available U.S. lobbying and campaign finance records and produces complex flowcharts to illustrate alleged relationships. But the group draws tenuous connections, claiming, for instance, that a USCIRF commissioner was influenced by Islamists because she once worked on a conservative fundraising committee alongside a lobbyist who went on to represent Muslim American groups,” claimed The Washington Post.In February this year, OpIndia reported in detail about the ties of former USCIRF Commissioner Anurima Bhargava to far-left billionaire George Soros. We also exposed how the controversial body has relied on the dubious ‘Tek Fog’ story to make insinuations about India.The Washington Post ensured to not include all conspiracy theories to set its ‘investigative article’ apart from that of ‘Pakistan Defence.’ The Pakistani website had even dubbed popular member and dermatologist Neelam Singh aka ‘The Skin Doctor’ as an aide to R&AW officer Lt. Colonel Dibya Satpathy.“The Evil nexus of Col Dibya Satpathy Indian ex-military intelligence officer and bjp troll farms. To (sic) manufacture and spread propaganda and misinformation with the help of Major Neelam “Neel” Kumari alias “The Skin Doctor”, Major Gaurav Arya,” it claimed.‘Pakistan Defence’ accused ‘The Skin Doctor’ of carrying out the ‘evil nexus’ of supposed ‘Disinfo Lab’ founder and Indian Intelligence officerThe Washington Post did not copy-paste the outrageous claims about ‘Disinfo Lab’ only from ‘Pakistan Defence’ but another Pakistani-based website named ‘Centre for Strategic and Contemporary Research (CSCR).Interestingly, CSCR published another misleading piece on ‘Disinfo Lab’ a year before that of ‘Pakistan Defence.’ Habitual fake news peddler and anti-Hindu activist CJ Werleman had made similar insinuations about the Indian OSINT handle in February last year.First, the claim of our association with Govt agencies/ RAW. The report is essentially a recycle of previous reports published by Pakistani ISPR/ Info-war machinery. The report is periodically recycled, last by known fake news peddler CJ Werleman.Lazy Journalism!(2/n) pic.twitter.com/0oXNGfrVyoIn November 2021, CJ Werleman had appealed to boycott Indian products to supposedly ‘save’ Muslims in India and Kashmir. Before that, he had tweeted a video of Pramod Muthalik, the chief of the Hindu activist group Shri Rama Sene, to allege that he called for violence against Muslims and the demolition of a mosque in Karnataka. Earlier, he claimed Indians had destroyed a Muslim graveyard in Himachal Pradesh, which was also fake news. In August 2021 when the Islamist group Taliban took over Afghanistan, Werleman was caught spreading Taliban propaganda. In September 2021, he called for ‘regime decapitation’ strikes against India.The Print, run by Shekhar Gupta had eulogised Werleman in a profile describing him as a ‘bigot-turned-crusader against ‘Islamophobia’ who is taking on the Indian state’. Since every anti-India propagandist is a potential source of The Washington Post, there will surely be no dearth of more anti-India hit pieces ahead of the 2024 elections.While hitting out at The Washington Post, ‘Disinfo Lab’ pointed out that the only difference in its article and past hitjobs against it is the addition of unnamed sources. “The only ‘upgrade’ the WaPo did was to make this Pakistani allegation ‘anonymous’. And whatever is in addition to that is again attributed to ‘anonymous’ sources. Hence, literally, every fact claimed is ‘anonymous’. The report has more than 10 anonymous sources,” it added.As pointed out earlier by OpIndia, The Washington Post failed to refute any assertions made by ‘Disinfo Lab.’ It also noted, “While, in their questions to us and other people, WaPo journalists have themselves noted that our claims are factually correct! (thanks for acknowledgement), they alleged that we make ‘tenuous claims’, and cited a few examples.”While calling out the bluff of the leftist newspaper, Disinfo Lab concluded that The Washington Post is overrated. “It is not surprising that people who don’t understand OSINT are baffled by our reporting. It is especially hard for legacy media journos – Indian and foreign alike, who have known journalism only as handouts from sources. Agencies are overrated. OSINT is underrated,” it emphasised.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

"12 December, 2023 ",Washington Post and its hit job on ‘Disinfo Lab’: Exposing the nefarious campaign to discredit Indian OSINT handle before 2024 Lok Sabha election,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/washington-post-hitjob-against-disinfo-lab-anti-india-propaganda-before-2024-elections/,"Ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha election, The Washington Post has launched a campaign of sorts to de-legitimise those exposing anti-India narratives and promote individuals disseminating propaganda against India.On Sunday (10th December), the leftist media outlet carried out a hit job on the Indian OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) handle ‘Disinfo Lab.’ To this effect, it published an article titled ‘Covert Indian operation seeks to discredit Modi’s critics in the U.S.’The development comes two days after American political commentator Jack Posobiec revealed how The Washington Post ‘journalist’ Priyanshu Verma had been soliciting information about ‘Disinfo Lab.’‘Disinfo Lab’ is the same OSINT handle, which earlier exposed how the US State Department was relying on misleading data (sourced from Christian evangelist groups and radical Islamist outfits) to allege a decline in India’s religious freedom.It was thus obvious that US-based leftist media outlets such as The Washington Post would make attempts to de-legitimise ‘Disinfo Lab’ sooner or later. Based on ‘sources’, Pranshu Verma and his two other colleagues claimed on Sunday (10th December) that the OSINT handle is run by an Indian Intelligence Officer named Lt. Col. Dibya Satpathy.The trio at The Washington Post alleged that the objective of ‘Disinfo Lab’ is to ‘research and discredit foreign critics of the Modi government’, ‘combine fact-based research with unsubstantiated claims’, ‘intimidate individuals overseas’ and ‘run covert influence operation.’However, a cursory look at the website of the OSINT handle reveals that it is focused on uncovering disinformation campaigns, aimed at tarnishing the image of India on a global scale. Nevertheless, this did not stop The Washington Post from making sweeping claims about it. “The Disinfo Lab’s activities show how the online propaganda campaigns waged by the BJP and its allies have been expanding beyond their traditional, domestic aims of shoring up popular support and denigrating opposition parties — and now seek to influence attitudes far beyond India’s borders,” it brazened out.The leftist media outlet roped in several ‘experts’ to suggest that the Indian government led by PM Narendra Modi is using an OSINT handle with 45.6K followers to undermine political rivals and create a global narrative.One such expert was an ‘academic’ named Joyjeet Pal. He claimed, “The Indian right wing is a new player that has arrived on the world stage and wants to shape global discussion…So far, much of it is done in the same way it’s done within India — through crude, blunt force. But it’s getting smarter.” The Washinton Post introduced Pal as a University of Michigan Professor ‘who studies disinformation in India.’ Interestingly, he is the same ‘expert’ whose obscure research was used by Indian leftist propaganda outlet The Wire to discredit calls for investigating the unnatural death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput.Claim: Raksha Mantri @rajnathsingh admitted on @CNNnews18 that Chinese soldiers crossed Indian side of LACFact: The Minister was referring to differing perceptions of LAC & presence of Chinese troops It is being misinterpreted as if Chinese troops entered Indian side of LAC pic.twitter.com/Xews6Ba1bqAnother controversial expert cited by The Washington Post in its report was ‘journalist’ Ajai Shukla. He claimed, “(The defence establishment) exists to serve national and strategic interests, not political interests. But the BJP under Modi has seen critics as anti-Indian, the enemies of India itself.”Shukla has a history of peddling fake news (here and here) in the context of the India-China border dispute. He had also disseminated conspiracy theories post the 2019 Pulwama terror attack and was dubbed sexist by a prominent Italian journalist. Despite such dwindling credibility, The Washington Post roped him as an expert for its propaganda-laden piece on ‘Disinfo Lab.’India has been under tremendous pressure to choose sides, following the Russia-Ukraine war. The US state apparatus and the media on several occasions had even threatened India with sanctions for purchasing oil from Russia, only to receive befitting replies from External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar.Nevertheless, The Washington Post saw it as an opportunity to attack India’s neutral position in the ongoing crisis. “Coordinated social media accounts have been found to play a role, for instance, in spreading identical posts in support of Russia, an important supplier of weapons and energy to India…” it furthered the US State narrative.The leftist news outlet targeted the ‘Disinfo Lab’ for exposing the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) and its biased reporting on India, which is often used to cast aspersions on Indian democracy.In February this year, OpIndia reported in detail about the ties of former USCIRF Commissioner Anurima Bhargava to far-left billionaire George Soros. We also exposed how the controversial body has relied on the dubious ‘Tek Fog’ story to make insinuations about India.Throughout its article, The Washington Post desperately tried to whitewash both anti-Hindu and anti-India activists and paint them as ‘victims’ of the social media exposé by ‘Disinfo Lab.’ One such activist mentioned by the leftist media outlet happens to be Pieter Friedrich, who has ties to Khalistani terrorist Bhajan Bhinder.“The organization released a dossier nearly 100 pages long alleging that Pieter Friedrich, a California-based activist and journalist who has written magazine articles and given public speeches critical of the BJP and affiliated Hindu-nationalist groups, had ties to the Sikh separatist movement and Pakistan’s premier intelligence agency. The Disinfo Lab burrowed into California state records to uncover Friedrich’s employment history, published his parents’ names and plotted detailed graphs about his social media activity,” it claimed.1) The days of people like Friedrich making threats against non-white people,especially because of the color of their skin, their religious affiliation, or their country of origin must remain behind us.In 2021, OpIndia reported how Pieter Friedrich evolved from a Christian zealot and a Gandhi basher to a ‘critic of Hindu fascism’ and a Khalistani asset. In June last year, he was slammed for allegedly giving death threats to a Hindu US Representative from Illinois, Raja Krishnamoorthi.The Washington Post lamented that ‘Disinfo Lab’, which posted a plethora of evidence tying ‘activist’ Sunita Vishwanath to far-left billionaire George Soros and his Open Society Foundations (OSF), was used against Congress scion Rahul Gandhi.“The Disinfo Lab dug into her past and reported that a nonprofit she launched to help female Afghan refugees had received funding from Soros’s Open Society Foundations. Two months later, after Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi attended a meeting in Washington with Viswanath as part of a U.S. tour, Amit Malviya, the head of the BJP’s social media team, tweeted a photo of the meeting and shared a flowchart stamped with the Disinfo Lab logo illustrating Viswanath’s connections to Soros,” wrote the leftist media outlet.Sunita Vishwanath is the co-founder of an organisation named ‘Women for Afghan Women’, which is funded by OSF. She is also the co-founder of ‘Hindus for Human Rights (HfHr)’ and has tried to create hysteria and panic among Indian Muslims about the National Register of Citizens (NRC).“We are especially appalled by the most recent nightmare of the Kashmiri people, and the situation of 1.9 million people in India who are rendered stateless due to the imposition of the travesty called the National Register of Citizens”, Vishwanath said in 2019. In September 2021, she also participated in the Hinduphobic conference ‘Dismantling Global Hindutva.’ The Washington Post also roped in the policy director of Hindus for Human Rights (HfHr), Ria Chakraborty, to make a case for an organisation named ‘Indian American Muslim Council (IAMC).’➡️IAMC's terror angleIAMC has close ties with terror organizations like SIMI, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jamaat-e-Islami.Infact, Mohammad Siddiqi, the founder of SIMI, was once hosted as a guest at IAMC.Research credit – @DisinfoLab pic.twitter.com/iufbOJy9gsAccording to the Hindu American Foundation (HAF), the Indian Americal Muslim Council has links [pdf] with the banned Islamic terror outfit, Students’ Islamic Movement of India (SIMI).Besides, the Indian American Muslim Council has ties with Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) through its founder Shaik Ubaid. The IAMC is a Jamat-e-Islami-backed lobbyist organisation claiming to be a rights advocacy group.It had been caught spreading fake news to further the Islamist cause in India. It had also been slapped with the UAPA in 2021.The Washington Post also made references to anti-Brahmin activist Thenmozhi Soundarajan and her organisation ‘Equality Labs’. Soundarajan had shot to fame in 2018 after the then Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey clicked pictures with a poster, designed by her, carrying the tagline ‘Smash Brahmanical Patriarchy.’In April 2022, tech giant Google cancelled a talk by Thenmozhi Soundararajan, owing to the fear that it might create ‘division and rancour’ in the workplace. Google spokesperson Shannon Newberry had said, “We also made the decision to not move forward with the proposed talk which — rather than bringing our community together and raising awareness — was creating division and rancour.”In November last year, she went on an unhinged tirade against Yoga. During the one-and-a-half-hour-long podcast, Soundararajan cast aspersions on the history of the ancient Indian Hindu practice and claimed that it was used by Brahmins to oppress the Dalit community. She also insinuated that Yoga had an in-built system of hierarchy, which supposedly made it vulnerable to abuse.What does it mean to address the structural violence at the heart of yoga? I break the silence on the religious abuse that is at the heart of yoga and how healing begins with debrahminizing and decolonizing. Check it on the latest #conspirituality pod https://t.co/7OadWRA1EP pic.twitter.com/gWgEWCwIv7The Washington Post also attempted to whitewash far-left billionaire George Soros and his nefarious anti-India agenda.The leftist media outlet wrote, “In February, Soros, a frequent critic of Modi, warned in a speech at the Munich Security Conference that the Indian leader was undemocratic and would lose his “stranglehold” over the Indian government. A day later, the Disinfo Lab posted a lengthy tweet thread alleging that Soros had ties to the Muslim Brotherhood and manipulated “fake” U.S.-based advocacy groups to smear India. A spokesperson for Soros’s Open Society Foundations called the Disinfo Lab’s claims “entirely baseless” and said they were part of a “campaign by this site and others in India against advocates of human rights, democratic governance and the rule of law in the service of the political aims of the BJP and its allies.”“India has been fighting a ‘perception war’ on all fronts since the start of 2023. On February 16 this year, George Soros exploited the Adani-Hindenburg controversy and launched a scathing attack on the Indian government.He claimed, “Modi and business tycoon Adani are close allies. Their fate is intertwined…Adani Enterprises tried to raise funds in the stock market, but it failed. Adani is accused of stock manipulation and his stock collapsed like a house of cards.”Soros accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of crony capitalism. “Modi is silent on the subject, but he will have to answer questions from foreign investors and in parliament,” he added.The Hungarian-American billionaire also said that the ‘shakedown’ caused to the Indian markets due to the Hindenburg Research report will result in ‘much needed institutional reforms’ and ‘democratic revival’. George Soros and his vicious ecosystem of NGOs, activists and journalists had been trying to prove PM Modi as an ‘electoral autocrat’ who needed to be ousted for the ‘greater good’ of this country. And it has been a work in progress for a long time.The Hungarian-American billionaire has also tried to use international institutions, which are funded by him, including Freedom House and  V-Dem (Varieties of Democracy) Institute to tarnish the image of India at a global level.In January 2020, the American billionaire committed $1 billion to start a global university to “fight nationalists” and climate change, calling them twin challenges that threaten the survival of our civilisation.Throughout the article, The Washington Post resorted to insinuations, and source-based allegations to discredit ‘Disinfo Lab.’ However, it failed to provide any empirical evidence that could dispute any claims of the Indian OSINT handle.The leftist news outlet had not refuted the assertion by ‘Disinfo lab’ that its exposé had led to the shutting down of several sources of fake data. “In its response to The Post, the Disinfo Lab pointed to its record of forcing “activists” and “human rights fronts” to shut down by exposing them,” it noted.Ironically, one such source of fake data, DOTO (Data of Database of the Oppressed), was cited by WaPo tech ‘journalist’ Pranshu Verma in an article in January 2023 to allege that ‘religious hatred’ is on the rise in India.Turned out DOTO was full of fabrication & outright imagination. We exposed their fabrication, after which they first tried revising their data and later deleted and disappeared.DOTO met its fate in October this year and is no more among us. (RIP!)(12/n) pic.twitter.com/y55TrdzNWS‘Disinfo Lab’ had earlier exposed the fabrications of DOTO, following which the latter first revised and then deleted the database. The OSINT handle also uncovered the lies of another dubious organisation called OFMI (Organization for Minorities of India), following which the latter shut shop permanently.But after our exposé they shut down OFMI, pulled down its website, deleted traces, and went into oblivion. Most of the activists associated with them have also removed all references to OFMI.(6/n) pic.twitter.com/uj0DRlnTkhThe leftist media outlet had reached out to prominent people in the hopes of deterring them from sharing informative posts by ‘Disinfo Lab’. The Washington Post ‘journalist’ Pranshu Verma messaged American political commentator Jack Posobiec on Friday (8th December) and claimed that the Indian OSINT handle is run by an Intelligence officer.“We are doing a story on a group called Disinformation Lab. Our reporting shows this group combines fact-based research with unsubstantiated claims to paint U.S. government figures, researchers, Indian American human-rights activists and international humanitarian groups as part of a conspiracy, purportedly led by global Islamic groups and the billionaire George Soros, to undermine India. Our analysis found you have retweeted this organisation’s content,” he claimed. Some guy claiming to be from the Washington Post, just sent me a long text message alleging that I retweeted a post from an Indian intel agency-run media outlet Here’s my response pic.twitter.com/hoQcJ4Gjv0He further added, “Do you know about the organization’s background? Our research has found Disinfo Lab is actually run by an Indian Intelligence Officer. Did you know that?“Pranshu Verma then sought a response from the American political commentator based on his unsubstantiated assertions. “Due to the sensitive nature of this story, the time for response is tight. Please provide a response by the end of day today, Friday, December 8th,” he emphasised.However, he did not anticipate a befitting reply from Jack Posobiec that would put ‘The Washington Post’ in the dock. ” So if it’s a intel agency run-media outlet that basically makes it the same as the Washington Post then?” the American political commentator wrote.Jack Posobiec told Verma that The Washington Post is a media outlet run by the United States Intelligence and by his ‘assertion’ would make it similar to ‘Disinfo Lab.’ As expected, the tech ‘journalist’ did not respond to the message.After the article was published, The Washington Post did not reproduce the actual response of Jack Posobiec. While resorting to shrewd dishonesty, it wrote,” Posobiec did not address whether he was familiar with the organisation’s background.“With the upcoming Lok Sabha elections in mind, The Washington Post is leaving no stone unturned to make insinuations about the Modi government and target individuals and accounts known for debunking anti-India propaganda.The development comes amidst growing concerns about ‘regime change’ operations in India and neighbouring Bangladesh. Just last month, The Washington Post published a misleading piece wherein it dubbed requests for action to X (formerly Twitter) against extemists by Indian government as ‘global standard for online censorship.’Earlier, it romanticised an Islamist named Raqib Hameed Naik in an article titled ‘Tracking rising religious hatred in India, from half a world away.’ A vicious fake news peddler, Raqib Hameed Naik is the founder of anti-Hindu disinformation outlet ‘Hindutva Watch.’He is also infamous for denying the Hindu genocide, perpetrated by radical Islamists in the Kashmir Valley, in the early 1990s. Naik had also mocked the Hindu ‘Shivling’ found inside the Gyanvapi mosque in Kashi.The Washington Post has also published a dubious report on India and its solar power systems. It has given editorial space to the likes of scam-accused ‘journalist’ Rana Ayyub to parrot the narrative of ‘Muslims are in danger in India.’None of these articles are random but serve a sinister agenda to create a narrative that paints the incumbent elected government as ‘anti-democracy’ and ‘anti-minority’.In the US, The Washington Post has attempted to distort public perceptions through its dissemination of the Russian disinformation hoax – A conspiracy theory that suggests that the victory of Donald Trump in the 2016 US Presidential election was influenced by Russia.It had also suppressed the ‘Hunter Biden Laptop’ story and influenced the outcome of the 2020 US Presidential election. With less than 6 months left for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the Indian public must be wary of attempts by Western publications to peddle their sinister agendaWhether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"15 December, 2023 ","Who is Shahrukh Pathan’s father: Convicted for 10 years over drug peddling, evidence of collusion with Pakistanis and more",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/who-is-shahrukh-pathan-father-convicted-10-years-drug-peddling-collusion-pakistani-delhi-riots/,"The bail order made several revelations about Shahrukh Patha, the case and the remorseless conduct of Pathan after he was arrested, based on the evidence provided by the prosecution which were accepted by the court. Shahrukh Pathan, who pointed a gun at a policeman during the anti-Hindu riots in North-East Delhi in 2020, was refused regular bail by a Delhi court on 14th December. The court stated it observed no need to grant him bail and Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat of Karkardooma Court noted, “Considering the conduct of the accused Shahrukh Pathan in jail during his judicial custody, his conduct prior to his being arrested, conduct during court proceedings and most importantly, the allegations against the accused which are being supported by the eyewitnesses and also the video footage, on any of the counts on which bail can be considered, the court sees nothing to set him enlarged on bail.”The bail order made several revelations about Shahrukh Patha,n the case and the remorseless conduct of Pathan after he was arrested, based on the evidence provided by the prosecution which was accepted by the court. The case pertains to the infamous picture where Shahrukh Pathan was seen holding a gun to a police officer’s head during the Delhi anti-hindu riots. During the riot, on the 24th of February 2020, a confrontation broke out between Jaffrabad Metro Station and Maujpur Bridge. There were more than 5,000 people who came face to face in that area. The anti-CAA protestors (Islamist mob) were pelting stones and brandishing guns. When the investigation was carried out, 3 cartridges were found at the spot where Shahrukh Pathan brandished a gun, aimed at the head of a police officer in uniform. The order details how Shahrukh Pathan first fired a few rounds at the crowd and refused to pay heed to the warnings issued by the police officer. When he advanced, for the safety of the crowd, the police officer stood in his path and did not move. When Pathan was at a distance of 9-10 feet from the police officer, he fired his weapon aimed at the police officer’s head to kill him. The police officer dodged the bullet but continued to stand there in his path so he couldn’t advance further and kill the Hindus. As the police officer refused to move, Pathan pushed the officer and then aimed the gun at his head again. When the police officer issued another warning after being pushed, Shahrukh Pathan fired at the crowd and started retreating. It was only after sustained interrogation that Shahrukh Pathan revealed his full identity and confessed to his involvement in the crime. The prosecution has also argued that Shahrukh Pathan was not only attempting to kill the police officer but was also leading the mob. Interestingly, the order reveals how Shahrukh Pathan was not cooperative during the investigation and refused to reveal the identity of other rioters who were involved. During the investigation, it is detailed, that Pathan also tried his best to mislead the police. He has also displayed aggressive and remorseless conduct in jail. The prosecution argued that if let out on bail, he could potentially influence witnesses and tamper with evidence. Also, given the fear of the 10-year jail term that could be handed to him, he could abscond. Taking into account his conduct inside the jail and during the investigation, the court agreed with the prosecution and refused to grant him bail. In the order document detailing the arguments of the prosecution, there was one specific argument that deserved further investigation. The prosecution had argued that Shahrukh Pathan’s father, Sabir Ali (alias Baldev Singh) was convicted for 10 years with a fine of Rs 1 lac under Section 14 of the Foreigners Act and sections of the NDPS Act. OpIndia pulled up the court judgement in the case where Shahrukh Pathan’s father was convicted by a Delhi court. The judgement convicting him was pronounced on 11th August 2016. The facts of the case, detailed in the court order, almost read like a movie. In January 2010, Meghalaya Police filed a complaint in Delhi that three Pakistani nationals Abdul Razzaq, Mohd. Saddique and Rafakat Ali who had been brought from Lampur Seva Sadan (FRRO detention centre) on 1st January 2010 to Guru Nanak Eye Hospital for their medical examination had escaped while they were being taken back. During the investigation to track down the missing Pakistanis, the visitor’s register which was maintained by Meghalaya Police was also checked. The entries in the register made from 28/9/2009 to 02/01/2010 revealed that two people – Anees Khan and Arbaz Khan – had met Abdul Razzaq and Saleem on 29/12/2009 and 30/12/2009. During interrogation, it was revealed that before absconding on 1/1/2010, the three Pakistanis had after going to Gurunanak Eye Hospital were first taken to Jama Masjid and then one of them (Abdul Razzak) was taken by him to Seelampur near Jaffarbad to collect money from someone. Anees and Arbaz were nephews of Sabir Ali. It is pertinent to understand here that the three Pakistanis were in India illegally and therefore, were being held at a detention centre. From the story so far, it is also clear that they were given harbour at Jama Masjid from where one of them was taken to Seelampur (near Jaffrabad) to collect money – the very area where the Delhi anti-Hindu riots had broken out in February 2020 – in which Shahrukh Pathan was also leading a mob. Based on this investigation, Sabir Ali (Baldev Singh), Anees Khan and Arbaz were called to the Special Cell office and inquiries were made from them. During interrogation, it was revealed that it was Sabir Ali (Baldev Singh) who had given money to Abdul Razzaq at Seelampur before he had absconded. Essentially, from the records so far, it is clear that it was Shahrukh Pathan’s father who had give money to a Pakistani before they had absconded. This money was give to the illegal in Seelampur. The numbers that were taken from the accused during interrogation were then thoroughly investigated after those detained and questioned – including the father of Shahrukh Pathan – were set free. During the surveillance of the numbers, it was revealed that the accused – including Pathan’s father – were involved in the business of fake currency and drugs. There was also an intercepted call where Sabir Ali had spoken about the international smuggling of drugs. After this surveillance, when a notice was served to Sabir Ali, Arbaz and Anees, they refused to answer the notice served by the special cell. The Special Cell then received information about a Charas and Smack delivery that Sabir Ali and his co-accused Sannaullah Mir were about to make. When the raiding party intercepted Ali and Mir, they discovered drugs in their possession. Substantial amounts of drugs were also found on the scooter of Sabir Ali – the substance in the scooter was heroin. After the subsequent arrest, Mir and Ali were interrogated separately. During interrogation, the father of Shahrukh Pathan, Sabir Ali, confessed that he was in the business of drugs and fake currency notes along with his associates Anees, Arbaz, Jarnail and Mir. He also disclosed how the police could arrest Jarnail Singh and revealed that on an earlier occasion, Singh had given him 2 lacs and drugs, parts of which were then distributed to the others. He also agreed to lead the police to another accused – Javed. Several of the co-accused were then arrested post-interrogation of Ali. In 2011, all the accused persons were charged for the offences u/s 29 r.w.s. 21, 20 and 23 of the NDPS Act and accused Sabir Ali was separately charged for the offence u/s 21(c), 25A of the NDPS Act and accused Sanaullah Mir was separately charged for the offence of u/s 20 (b) (ii) (C) of the NDPS Act. All the accused persons were also charged for the offences u/s 489 C r.w.s. 120B IPC.In court, the prosecution examined 39 witnesses in all to prove its case against the accused. All the accused, including the father of Shahrukh Pathan, took the defence that they had been falsely implicated by the police and that no contraband/counterfeit currency notes had been recovered from their possession or at their instance at any point in time. Among all the accused, the court ‘particularly’ was intrigued by the defence of Sabir Ali alias Baldev Singh. It is pertinent to mention here that Shahrukh Pathan’s father was previously a Sikh named Baldev Singh and had converted to Islam before marrying. When Sabir Ali started explaining why he was supposedly implicated by the police, he ended up revealing his long illustrious career as a criminal. Here is what the court document said: “In particular accused Baldev Singh has stated that he originally belongs to Punjab and shifted to Delhi in 1984 due to political turmoil and terrorist activities in Punjab. In Delhi he started selling garments from a patri in Chandni Chowk but in the year 1984 the police officials of Maurice Nagar falsely arrested him on a mere suspicion that he was a terrorist. When their enquiry into his antecedents did not reveal anything incriminating against him, they planted contraband on him and falsely implicated him in a case under the Excise Act. After spending three years in the jail in the said case, he came out and started working as a driver for a transport company. During the said services a vehicle which he was driving was intercepted by DRI and contraband was recovered from the same. Though he had no knowledge and had nothing to do with the contraband concealed in the said vehicle, he was arrested by DRI and also subsequently convicted in the said case and again spent more than 10 years in judicial custody. After coming out from the jail after undergoing the sentence in the said case he again started his life afresh and started doing the business of pannis/plastics and started living with his children, his wife, his brother in law, Anees and Arbaz, the son of his second brother in law Babu Khan, in his house H.No. U­108, Gali no. 5, Arvind Nagar, Gautam Vihar, Gonda. He suspects that somebody in his locality informed the local police officials about his previous records and that is why the officials of Special Cell came to his residence in the first week of January, 2010 and forcibly picked him, his son and Anees and Arbaz and took them to PS and started inquiring about same Pakistani nationals who had absconded. Though they were released from the PS after the police officials found nothing incriminating against them, on 3/9/2010 again he, Anees and Arbaz were forcibly picked up from their residence at 1:30 a.m. in the night and brought to the office of Special cell, Rohini and falsely implicated in this case”. Essentially, Shahrukh Pathan’s father at the time had asserted that he was being falsely implicated by the police in this case of collusion with Pakistanis and being involved in an international drug peddling and fake currency racket because he had done exactly that in the past, been convicted for it, and therefore, the police thought of him as a convenient target. Further, he also dared to claim that all the previous times he was caught with contrabands and convicted, even then, he was falsely implicated. The shoddy defence that was put up by Sabir Ali was backed only by one witness – the witness’ only testimony was that he had never seen a Pakistani enter the home of Ali. This statement was made without any evidence. The court said, “The testimony of the prosecution witnesses is trustworthy and believable and nothing has emerged in their cross­examination which cast doubt on the veracity of their statement or to impeach their creditworthiness”. The court also said that all the seizure of drugs and fake currency was done per the law. While the defence tried to puncture technical holes in the process, the court threw out all of their arguments and convicted the accused – including Sabir Ali. To that effect, the court said, “as far as recovery of contraband from accused Baldev Singh and Sanaullah is concerned, in my view, the prosecution has been able to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt”. While the court rejected the argument that the accused were colluding with each other, it convicted all accused for the possession of contraband substances, however, there was amply evidence of collusion as well based on the statements of Ali. Based on this evidence, Sabir Ali, the father of Shahrukh Pathan, was sentenced to 10 years in prison and 1 lac fine in 2016. According to reports, Shahrukh’s mother also is said to be a notorious drug peddler.In his show ‘Prime Time’ on 26th February 2020, Ravish Kumar resorted to spreading half-truths and full lies about the horrifying spate of violence that had engulfed the national capital. In pursuance of what appeared as his agenda to tarnish Hindus and portray them as the aggressors of the riots, Kumar identified Mohammad Shahrukh alias Shahrukh Pathan, who fired at Delhi Police personnel on February 24, as one ‘Anurag Mishra’. For the 26th February show, Ravish claimed that police had not yet arrested him while he was arrested on 25th February itself, good 24 hours before his show premiered. “Police ki haalat yeh hai ki abhi tak giraftar nahin hua hai. Police saaf kehti hai ki Shahrukh hai magar aap social media mein dekhiye Anurag Mishra bataya jaa raha hai. (Situation of the Police is such that they have not yet arrested him. Police says his name is Shahrukh but if you see on social media, he is called Anurag Mishra),” he spoke in his characteristic drawl during the show. Naturally, it was quite a revelation since no one had yet referred to the shooter as “Anurag Mishra” till then.He then asked Delhi Police to speak out on his identity again. He then played an undated speech of his reporter who appeared to be asking Delhi Police personnel about Shahrukh’s arrest. Slyly, Ravish Kumar then played the videos of BJP leaders Anurag Thakur, Kapil Mishra and Pravesh Verma addressing rallies ahead of Delhi elections to cast aspersions that their speeches were responsible for stoking riots a month later. Further, in August 2021, 18 months after the 25-year-old Delhi anti-Hindu riots accused Shahrukh Pathan was arrested for brandishing a gun at the police and threatening them, The Quint published a white paper on him watering down his crime and making him appear like a cherubic saint. The Quint started by describing his menacing march as ‘brazen confidence in his gait’. Then the writer of the ‘Shahrukh Pathan fan page’ romanticised his criminal act. “Unfazed by the policemen in riot gear, he shot bullets in the air while media persons captured his acts in astonishment. The fact that the gym enthusiast, who was also a local, did not wear a mask to hide his identity, made his ‘bravado’ seem peculiar and odd,” the author wrote. The Quint then went on to explain how his friends described Shahrukh as someone who was into grooming and was interested in his appearance. He was characterised as someone who was a biryani-lover, liked to put gel in his hair, blow dry it, wear crisp, ironed shirts, good shoes and well, make TikTok videos. The author interviewed Pathan’s mother, who had glowing views about her son. She said her son was innocent and ‘simple-minded’.Shahrukh’s mother also highlighted counterfactual scenarios to water down her son’s criminality. She told his fans at The Quint that she often wonders, “What if she had given him food when he asked? What if the timing was a few minutes before or after namaz?” Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

"15 December, 2023 ","Pune: Govt land in Kondhwa’s Hindu locality allotted for playground being converted into Muslim ‘Qabristan’, residents complain. Here’s all you need to know",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/pune-govt-land-kondhwa-hindu-locality-playground-converted-into-muslim-qabristan/,"The letter submitted by the societies around survey no 44 amenity space states that there are around 12000-15000 Hindu families residing in the locality and hardly any Muslim people stay in the societies. ""There are also several temples in the area and converting the space into a Muslim burial ground might harm our religious sentiments,"" the letter reads. In a shocking case that has come to the fore from the Kondhwa region of Maharashtra’s Pune district, government land that had been earlier allotted for the construction of a playground is now being converted into a Muslim burial ground. This is after the former NCP MLA Chetan Tupe and BJP’s Yogesh Tilekar submitted a letter to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) suggesting that the amenity space around some of the Hindu societies in Kondhwa could be the perfect location to build a burial ground (Qabristan) for the Muslim community.BJP’s Yogesh Tilekar later backtracked from the suggestion, reportedly after realising the problems of the locals and after he was informed about the issues in the area.  The letter claimed that the Kondhwa region in Pune has a large Muslim population and that it would be favorable for the community to have a burial ground nearby. Former Hadapsar @NCPspeaks MLA Chetan Tupe @ChetanVTupe n @BJP4Maharashtra leader Yogesh Tilekar @iYogeshTilekar recommended converting a Hindu-majority residential area's of #Kondhwa playground into a Muslim burial ground. Pune Municipal Corporation @PMCPune has spent 46 lakh… pic.twitter.com/AKS6vc0FfaSeveral Hindu societies around the said amenity space (survey no. 44) have complained to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) objecting to the construction of a burial ground for the Muslim community. “The societies around the plot are Hindu societies and several thousand Hindu families reside in this location. Several Hindu temples are also located in the area and building a burial ground for the Muslim community here might cause religious harm to the residents,” the letter by Raviraj Colorado Co-op Housing Society read. The complaint dated 23rd October has been exclusively obtained by OpIndia upon which no action has been taken by the PMC yet. Similar complaint letters have been submitted by Achalnagar Sahakari Gruharachana Society Ltd and Shree Vardhaman Nagar Co-op Housing Society Ltd to the PMC highlighting that around 12000 to 15000 Hindu families reside in the locality and that it would be wrong to allow amenity space that was supposed to be a playground for a Muslim burial ground. The complaint letters obtained by OpIndia have been signed by all the society members who are Hindus. Amenity space is a portion of a building that adds convenience for all occupants of a building and that is not used exclusively by any one occupant. In the current case, the amenity space is just a wall close to societies that have registered complaints and the space is authoritatively looked after by the PMC. The controversy has been long-standing since the year 2021 when NCP MLA Chetan Tupe Patil submitted a letter to the PMC suggesting that the amenity space on survey no. 44 plot should be made a Muslim burial ground given that the Kondhwa region in Pune houses a large Muslim population. However, in between these years, it was later advised by the PMC’s Amenity Space Committee that a Muslim burial ground would be constructed in the amenity space on surveys no. 18 and 19 and that a playground would be constructed on survey no. 44 space. The Muslim community members then happened to press that a burial ground on survey no. 44 space would be better given the closer distance and that the supposed burial ground in Survey no 18 and 19 space would cause commuting problems for the community. Several letters to PMC pressing their demand for survey no 44 space were sent by the Nagarsevak, Adv Abdul Gafar Pathan, Parveen Haji Firoz Sheikh, and former NCP MLA Chetan Tupe Patil. The letters erroneously claimed that most of the population residing around the survey no. 44 plots were Muslims and it would be a feasible space for Muslim burial ground. A similar letter advocating for a Qabristan on survey no. 44 land was submitted by the BJP’s Yogesh Tilekar on 8th May 2023 to the PMC. The letter stated that survey no. 18 and 19 spaces were too far from the Muslim locality residing in Kondhwa and that making a burial ground on survey no. 44 space would be feasible instead. The PMC on 16th May then approved the proposal based on the letter submitted by Tilekar. However, it has come to the fore that Tilekar submitted the letter after the local Muslim community members sought his help regarding the land issue. The Muslim community representatives informed Tilekar that a maximum of the Muslim population resides around survey no. 44 amenity space and that it should be converted into a Muslim burial ground. OpIndia talked to BJP MLA Yogesh Tilekar confirming the incident. He exclusively informed OpIndia that he was misinformed about the survey no. 44 spaces and the ongoing project of playground construction on the land. “I didn’t know the land was already allotted by the PMC for a playground construction. Neither did the local Muslim representatives tell me nor the PMC. The letter I sent in May 2023 pressed for a burial ground on survey no. 44 space. However, after I learned that the maximum of population residing around the survey no. 44 space is Hindu, I sent another letter demanding the cancellation of the allotment of the land for a Muslim burial ground,” Tilekar said while talking to OpIndia. The letter of cancellation that Tilekar sent to the PMC on 23rd October 2023 clearly states that the survey no. 44 amenity space is located in a crowded area and most of the population that resides in the societies around the space is Hindu. “I first thought that the area housed a large Muslim population but I was misinformed. Most of the population residing in the locality is Hindu,” the letter reads. The entire incident was exposed after an RTI activist Dr Paritosh Zaware Patil residing in the Raviraj Colorado Co-op Housing Society (next to survey no 44 amenity space) filed an RTI demanding details of the location. It came to the fore that the PMC had already allotted the land for the construction of a playground and that the government had already spent Rs 43 lakhs for construction. Surprisingly, the land still is vacant and is under controversy over the Muslim burial ground construction. The land was allotted for the construction of the playground in the year 2017 and in 2019 grant of Rs 43 lakhs for the purpose was also obtained. The project of construction of the playground was given to some Salim Construction in the year 2019 and Rs 49 lakhs had been spent for the purpose. “The land is still vacant and no playground has been constructed here. Instead, they want to make a Muslim burial ground here. This is a crowded locality and we don’t want our children to see anything that would not be good for their age,” Dr Patil confirmed. Dr. Paristosh Patil while talking to OpIndia confirmed that survey no 18 and 19 are in the East part of the Kondhwa region and that it still stands vacant. “Some people had demanded that a vegetable market should be developed there. However, in the Amenity space committee meeting, the PMC denied the permission. That land can easily be converted into a Muslim burial ground. No problem at all. But the Muslim community members want survey no 44 amenity space only which is located in the crowded Hindu locality. They say that it is a closer option for them.” Patil added that he or the other society members have nothing to do with the community. “We are not against the Muslim community. Our problem is the burial ground. How can it be constructed in a densely crowded residential locality? All our society’s flat doors face the ground and families stay with us. What if our children ask tomorrow about the burials? Like what it is and why does this happen? Many children residing in the society are too young to see this. Even if there was a demand for Hindu cremation ground, we would have opposed it,” he added. The letter submitted by the societies around survey no 44 amenity space states that there are around 12000-15000 Hindu families residing in the locality and hardly any Muslim people stay in the societies. “There are also several temples in the area and converting the space into a Muslim burial ground might harm our religious sentiments,” the letter reads. The complaint also says that constructing a Muslim burial ground might create health hazards. “Water used for the process might seep into the society pipes causing health hazards. The societies and the survey no 44 amenity space are just a wall away from each other,” Dr Patil confirmed. Team OpIndia also talked to some of the other society residents to know about the Muslim burial ground being constructed on the nearby premises. One of the Raviraj Colorado society residents stated that several unknown persons are calling the society residents after the complaint to the PMC saying the Muslim burial ground will be built on survey no. 44 land come what may. “People are threatening us and saying that the inauguration of the burial ground will be executed in January next year. We all are scared and don’t want to see people getting buried there,” said Neelam Shah, one of the residents (name changed for security reasons). She further added that several Hindu organizations and concerned legal committees are looking into the case and people here are even ready to protest. “The roadway to the ground is really narrow as the locality is already crowded. Single lanes lead to the ground in question. School buses also pass through the same routes. Imagine now if someone dies from their community (God forbid) and they get the body to the ground for burial and then there’s also a bus passing through the same route.. our children will be forced to see what they should not at this age? Moreover, the traffic issues might also increase. The Muslim burial ground here is a bad idea,” she pressed. Neelam further added that the amenity space which is vacant at present is used by some of the miscreants to carry out immoral and illegal activities. On asking about the ‘immoral activities’, Shah said that people use the site for drinking and all wrong purposes after the evening hours. “This also should stop,” she demanded.The resident also added that some of the people living in the societies are leaving their properties and selling at a loss due to the increasing influence of the Muslim community. “The Muslim burial ground is making people leave their hard-earned homes. This is not done,” she adds. Another resident Jyotsna Patil (name changed for security reasons) also confirmed that most of the population staying here in the Kondhwa region is Hindu. “The burial ground can result in severe health hazards. Not instantly but in the coming 4-5 years people will notice changes in the environment here and their health to be specific. This is hazardous. Also, this is a Hindu community crowded space. Religiously, it would be incorrect to have another community burial ground here. Strict action should be taken in this case,” Patil said. The PMC is said to have taken action based on the letter submitted by BJP’s Yogesh Tilekar. However, Tilekar stated that he was misinformed about the location and that no he is ready to do anything to stop the ‘playground’ being converted into a Muslim burial ground. Reportedly, the Amenity Space Committee of Pune Municipal Corporation has taken no action on the cancellation request submitted by the BJP MLA. The decision shall be taken in the upcoming meeting of the body. At present, the amenity space contains a jogging track and a few rest places. The remaining portion of the land stands vacant. It is important to note that Pune’s Kondhwa region has been in the news for some time. In July this year, the National Investigation Agency arrested a doctor from the Kondhwa region for sheltering ISIS members. Also, three residents from the Mithanagar area of Kondhwa had been arrested by NIA for promoting terrorist activities at the behest of the global terrorist outfit Islamic State (IS). Later, in August, it had come to the fore that the accused ISIS operatives organized and participated in bomb-making workshops in Pune’s Kondhwa area in 2022. The central investigation agency received credible intelligence that these accused and their associates were recruiting youth and training them to make Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) and weapons. They also shared Do It Yourself (DIY) kits and other relevant materials among themselves for creating IEDs and manufacturing small weapons, pistols, and more. Notably, the accused were also involved in creating content for the pro-ISIS magazine ‘Voice of Hind’. The online magazine led to several raids by the NIA in October 2021 in Kashmir. On 5th August, the accused were sent to ATS custody by a Pune court. ATS informed the court they found incriminating material from the accused, including an Indian map with several cities marked, laptops containing material to study the modus operandi of terror attacks, and more. The initial probe revealed they have links to the Al Sufa module. However, a later investigation revealed they all were part of ISIS.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"14 December, 2023 ",Parliament security breach: How the intruders smuggled smoke canisters inside the high-security premises,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/parliament-security-breach-how-the-intruders-smuggled-smoke-canisters/,"Hundreds of visitors are arriving at the parliament daily, especially after the inauguration of the new parliament, however, the staff is limited. In a major security breach since the 2001 Parliament attack, two persons jumped into the Lok Sabha well on December 13 from the visitors’ gallery while the proceedings were going on and released yellow-coloured smoke from canisters. The question here arises that despite multiple security checks and frisking, how did the intruders manage to smuggle the smoke canisters inside the Parliament. Apparently, the intruders carried the smoke canisters in the shoes they were wearing.Notably, the Parliament Security Service operates under the administrative control of the Joint Secretary (Security) of the Lok Sabha Secretariat and oversees the security operations of both Secretariats. After the deadly attacks on the Parliament in 2001, several measures were taken to streamline the access points, advanced security gadgets were deployed, and a high-tech access control system was implemented to ensure the safety and security of the MPs and VVIPs. In addition, Radio Frequency Tags were introduced to enhance the identification processes.The intruders Sagar Sharma and Manoranjan managed to breach the three-tier security of the parliament. The initial check is undertaken at the Parliament premises’ entry gate. Subsequently, another check is conducted involving metal detectors and hand-held metal detector frisking. This is followed by another round of checking at the Parliament building’s entrance gate, with additional security deployed in the corridor leading to the visitors’ galleries. While the visitors were not allowed to carry cell phones inside the gallery, the intruders were skillfully carrying smoke canisters made of plastic in their shoes.An obvious question that comes to the mind here is why was the smoke cannister not detected during any of the three tiers of security checks including metal detector frisking. To understand this, one must recall the “Shoe Bomber” Richard Reid’s failed attempt to detonate a bomb on American Airlines Flight 63 from Paris to Miami 22 years back on December 22, 2001. Richard Reid had converted to Islam and joined the Islamic terrorist group Al-Qaeda. Interestingly, Reid was carrying the bomb with around 10 ounces of explosives in his shoes when he boarded the flight. Despite the prior security checks, the bomb Reid was carrying could not be detected.Fortunately, the terrorist failed in his attempt to blow up the plane mid-air as a co-passenger smelled the sulphur and Reid was then pinned down, sedated and eventually handed over to the security officials. This incident, however, demonstrated that, unless shoes are removed and checked separately, they can pass through security with plastic explosives stuffed within. For this, in the US and Europe, passengers at the airport are required to take off their shoes, belts, all metallic objects, cellphones and other electronic items in a separate tray before passing through the metal detectors.During the security checks at the parliament, the officials usually do not check the shoes of the visitors. As reported earlier, two of the accused had conducted recce outside the parliament beforehand, during the Budget session as well as the monsoon session. Had the frisking staff regularly checked the insides or the soles of the shoes of the visitors including those of the two intruders on Wednesday, the duo could have been caught beforehand. The incident has aptly triggered a serious review of the security arrangements as there could been noxious contents in the canisters smuggled in by the now-arrested intruders. Citing a Parliament Security Services official, Indian Express reported that hundreds of visitors are arriving at the parliament daily, especially after the inauguration of the new parliament, however, the staff is limited. The report adds citing sources that “301 security officers are usually deployed inside Parliament, but on Wednesday, 176 were present.”Notably, the security breach took place at 1 PM on December during the zero hour in the Lok Sabha, just before the lunch break. When Khagen Murmu, BJP MP from West Bengal, was raising some points regarding his constituency, a commotion was suddenly heard in the background. When the Sansad TV switched to the view of the entire hall, a man could be seen who had already jumped from the gallery and was on the benches. He then started to proceed towards the front of the hall, jumping from bench to bench.  #WATCH | An unidentified man jumps from the visitor's gallery of Lok Sabha after which there was a slight commotion and the House was adjourned. pic.twitter.com/Fas1LQyaO4A video from the Lok Sabha shows the members of Parliament assaulting one of the two perpetrators who burst into the chamber during proceedings and tossed canisters emitting yellow smoke. The MPs can be seen plucking the hairs of the intruder, hurling shoes at him, and landing punches at him before encircling him. Meanwhile, the Lok Sabha secretariat has reportedly suspended eight security officials in connection with the security breach. As the Winter Session of Parliament resumed this morning, security measures were significantly increased.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"13 December, 2023 ",Omidyar decides to shut shop in India after ‘achieving the goal of catalysing impact’: But here’s why its story might not be over,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/omidyar-decides-to-shut-shop-in-india-no-more-new-investments/,"It is pertinent to note that apart from Omidyar, other donors to Forbidden Story include George Soros’ Open Society Foundations (OSF), whose attitude towards the Indian Government is well documented, and Wellspring Philanthropic Fund, which is cloaked in a shroud of secrecy. Omidyar Network India will exit the Indian market by the end of the year 2024 and will not make any new investments in the country, News website Yourstory first reported on 12th December (Tuesday). Omidyar Network is reportedly a self-styled “philanthropic investment firm” comprising a foundation and an impact investment firm. It was established in 2004 by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar, a French-born Iranian-American and his wife Pam. In 2019, Omidyar Network India was carved out of its parent entity, the US-based Omidyar Network. The Omidyar Network India, however, will keep following up on deals it had committed earlier, as per sources familiar with the development. Omidyar Group has been active in India since 2010 and has made investments of over $500 million. Out of this nearly $150 million was directed to non-profit investments. It has invested in several startups in India like ZestMoney, DealShare, VerSe (Dailyhunt), Vedantu, 1mg, Bounce, Bijak, Doubtnut, Entri, HealthKart, Indifi, M2P, Pratilipi, and in several media organisations, particularly the leftist portals like Newslaundry. Confirming the development in an internal blog post which was reviewed by YourStory, the firm stated, “After several months of deliberation, it has been decided that Omidyar Network India will stop making new investments and will completely transition out of the market by the end of 2024. Over the next two months, the board and leadership team will assess how best to manage the organisation’s portfolio while recognising the long and trusted partnerships that the Omidyar Network India team has built.” In their statement, Omidyar Network India asserted that it has achieved its primary objective of “catalysing impact” and will not make any new investment. The statement read, “Over the last decade, Omidyar Network India has played a critical role in building the impact investment sector, especially focussed on the Next Half Billion. We are proud of our work in this space, which is now attracting larger pools of capital from local venture capital or impact investors and domestic philanthropists than ever before. Having achieved our primary objective of catalysing impact, Omidyar Network India will not be making any further investments in India.” Conspicuously, Omidyar Network is known for funding many publications, particularly the leftist portals across India including Scroll(dot)in and Newslaundry.Leftist portals like Newslaundry which are under agencies’ scanner for alleged tax evasions and FCRA violations had been receiving funding from Omidyar Network. In September 2021, the Income Tax department carried out a “survey operation” at the office of the website Newslaundry as part of an investigation into the finances and funding of the organisation.Back then, an IT official had said, “NewsClick and Newslaundry received Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) at a very high premium while their net worth was very low. There are also gaps in the financials of both the companies, which suggest tax evasion but we are verifying the same.”Newslaundry received funding from the Odimyar Network in 2016, “to expand its reportage and content production teams, leverage its existing content by increasing its exposure to a larger audience, and experiment with new formats of content creation”.Newslaundry’s Editor-in-Chief Madhu Trehan in an email response to The Print confirmed that Omidyar Network has been funding Newslaundry. The email read, “If you look at our website, you can see how much stake Omidyar Network owns in Newslaundry. It is up on our website. The amount raised and equity percentage is on what was then the FIPB website, and that is public information.” According to the Newslaundry website, the majority of the company’s equity is held by its three co-founders, Abhinandan Sekhri, Roopak Kapoor, and Prashant Sareen, and by an impact fund Omidyar Network.  In 2016, the Omidyar Network issued a public statement on its website at the time of investing in Newslaundry. It read, “Our purpose in funding Newslaundry is to invest in a media organisation that is exploring innovative approaches to drive transparency and higher standards throughout the media landscape in India. We also hope that the learnings from Newslaundry’s journey to develop a new business model for independent news production will act as a blueprint for other organisations to follow, develop, and spread.”Meanwhile, Newsclick founder Prabir Purkayastha has been addressing several events organised by organisations that receive funds from abroad, including from the Omidyar Network. As per an India Today report, in its initial years in India, Omidyar Network backed around 25 organisations that deal with news and government transparency. These organisations include News Trust, a news-discovery site run by the nonprofit journalism center, the Poynter Institute; the Sunlight Foundation, dedicated to government transparency; and Transparency & Accountability Initiative, an organisation based in London.In July 2020, Omidyar Network India funded Rs. 10.75 crore for 67 projects under the rapid response funding initiative for COVID-19 across the country. The initiative was launched on 24th March 2020 and it funded organisations like change.org, Kailash Satyarthi Children’s Foundation, and crowdfunding platform Milaap. Another major beneficiary of Omidyar Network is ADR (Association for Democratic Reforms), which also has the Ford Foundation as one of its donors. In January 2019, Regional language news aggregator Dailyhunt raised Rs 24.61 crore in funding from Omidyar Network and Sequoia Capital among others. Additionally, Verse Innovation, the parent company of Dailyhunt and short video platform Josh, also counts Omidyar Network as its investor.Apart from that, in 2019, it came to light that the Omidyar Group was one of the donors to Forbidden Stories (FS), a dubious organisation launched with the underlying aim of effectuating regime changes and installing pliant governments in countries across the world that align with the left-liberal ideology and reinforce the primacy of the Left’s narrative.FS was launched by Reporters Without Borders (RSF) and Freedom Voices Network. RSF is the same organisation that came up with a dishonest ‘Press Freedom Index‘ to malign India internationally and portray it as a country where journalists are targeted and persecuted for pursuing truth.The Omidyar Group donated to FS through a front organisation Luminate, whose Strategic Plan for 2018-2022 mentioned “Illiberal democracies’ are emerging,” “Civic space is shrinking, and civil society is under attack,” “Rising populism is creating ruptures in historical party politics,” “Insular, nationalist perspectives are resonating with more people,” and “Communities are becoming more polarized among other things.While the strategic plan and its animosity towards nationalism made its ideological orientations abundantly clear, it is important to note that the Omidyar Group funded a host of media organisations worldwide, mostly leftist globalist portals such as Scroll.in. Scroll Media Inc., the operator of the news portal Scroll.in, secured funding from the Omidyar Network in 2014. However, the exact amount of the funding was not disclosed. During that period, Samir Patil, the CEO of Scroll, mentioned, “We cannot disclose the deal size.”Additionally, in 2008, the Soros Economic Development Fund (SEDF) had joined hands with Omidyar Network, the Indian School of Business (ISB), and Google.org to launch their 17 million SONG fund to boost investment. Furthermore, Soros’ Foundation and Omidyar Network have also funded $1.3 million to Poynter’s International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN), with a long track record of attempts to thrust a biased fact-checking regime on India’s IFCN network.In September 2023, a coalition of 22 groups, including prominent left-wing organisations pledged more than $500 million to fund local media publications in the next five years, according to an announcement.The new coalition named “Press Forward” includes many groups that have left-wing bias based on their funding and initiatives. One of the groups in this alliance is Democracy Fund, an organisation run by left-wing billionaire Pierre Omidyar.According to tax documents obtained by an independent journalist Lee Fang, Democracy Fund reportedly provided a $130,000 grant to the Center for Internet Security to fund a “portal” that was used to flag and censor social media content containing “misinformation” during the 2020 election.It is pertinent to note that apart from Omidyar, other donors to Forbidden Story include George Soros’ Open Society Foundations (OSF), whose attitude towards the Indian Government is well documented, and Wellspring Philanthropic Fund, which is cloaked in a shroud of secrecy. FS also proudly displayed the endorsement by Mediapart’s Head of Investigations Fabrice Afri on its website until recently. Mediapart is the same leftist French organisation that has been peddling propaganda over the Rafale deal. FS has now removed the page “The support us” altogether from its website.Incidentally, in July 2021, the leftist news portal Wire published what it called an ‘explosive story‘ involving allegations of spying with spyware Pegasus. The Wire and its partners were fed the information by two very dubious organisations. One was Amnesty International and the other was Forbidden Stories.In May 2022, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) named the promoters of NGO Omidyar Network and several others including government officials in an FCRA bribery scandal case. The development came after the CBI had filed an FIR regarding a national FCRA funding scam. According to reports, the promoters of NGO Omidyar Network have been under the scanner for allegedly bribing officials to receive FCRA licenses. Additionally, at least 6 to 8 more networks were also under the CBI scanner.Before that, in September 2021, the Ministry of Home Affairs had put the Omidyar Network under the FCRA watchlist.In a nutshell, Omidyar Group invested in organisations and efforts that were aimed to dislodge governments and regimes it thought did not align with the “liberal worldview” by bankrolling news organisations, entities, movies, etc that they thought would aid them in building an alternative narrative and challenging the legitimacy of the incumbent governments they did not like. It had been a “catalysing impact” through various organisations that have been cloaked as non-profit, ideologically independent entities but in reality, have been trying to achieve their vested agenda of pliant governments in the host country.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

It is situated within the Parliament House Complex. It operates under the administrative control of the Joint Secretary (Security) of the Lok Sabha Secretariat and oversees the security operations of both Secretariats.In August 2020, “Unified Operational Command” was established under the Joint Secretary (Security) to enhance the efficiency and coordination among the security personnel. The unified command integrates the security services of both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha Secretariats. Establishing a Unified Operational Command was to ensure uniformity in decision-making processes related to security matters. Notably, the separate Security Services of both houses run simultaneously as their structures are different.Following the tragic terrorist attack on the Parliament House in 2001, the government of India did a comprehensive review of the security arrangements. Subsequent measures were taken to streamline the access points, advanced security gadgets were deployed, and a high-tech access control system was implemented to ensure the safety and security of the MPs and VVIPs. Furthermore, Radio Frequency Tags were introduced to enhance the identification processes and regulate the vehicular movement inside the complex.The Parliament Security Service plays different roles in the complex, including providing security cover to the VVIPs, Members of Parliament, and visitors and conducting anti-sabotage and anti-explosive checks. Other agencies, including Delhi Police, Intelligence Bureau, Parliament Duty Group, Special Protection Group and National Security Guard, coordinate with the Parliament Security Service to ensure smooth operations in the Parliament.Apart from providing security, Parliament Security Service is also responsible for activities, including guiding visitors through the Parliament House Complex and providing informative sessions on the history of Parliament and its proceedings.Parliament Security Service personnel are also deployed for national ceremonies, international conferences, and other events where security is paramount.In a massive security breach in the Parliament, two men jumped into the Lok Sabha well from the visitors’ gallery while the proceedings were going on today, 13 December. After jumping into the well, the two men released some yellow-coloured smoke from canisters. The invasion of the parliament took place on the anniversary of the parliament attack in 2001.Two more people carrying smoke cans were detained outside the parliament.

"16 December, 2023 ",Actor Allu Arjun turns down multi-crore liquor and tobacco advertisement deal for upcoming Pushpa sequel,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/actor-allu-arjun-turns-down-multi-crore-liquor-and-tobacco-ad-deal/,"Allu Arjun rejected the brand's offer of Rs 10 crore for its logo to be displayed on screen every time he smokes or chews tobacco as 'Pushpa' in the much-awaited sequel ""Pushpa: The Rule"".Actor Allu Arjun has rejected a popular liquor and pan masala brand’s lucrative advertisement deal. The “Pushpa: The Rise” fame actor reportedly rejected the brand’s offer of Rs 10 crore for its logo to be displayed on screen every time he smokes or chews tobacco as ‘Pushpa’ in the much-awaited sequel “Pushpa: The Rule”. The actor turned down the offer saying that it goes against his ethics and is “comfortable” in promoting such brands.This, however, is not the first time the Telugu sensation has refused an ad deal offered by liquor and pan masala brands. In August this year, similar reports emerged about the actor refusing to sign a multi-crore deal with a tobacco and liquor brand. The actor reportedly said that he himself does not consume tobacco and does not wish to encourage his fans to do the same.It is worth recalling that in April this year, KGF fame superstar Yash had refused a tobacco brand deal. The actor rejected the multi-crore deal since he wanted to give the right message to his fans and followers.Interestingly, while these south superstars rejected tobacco brand deals, Bollywood biggies Ajay Devgn, Shahrukh Khan and Akshay Kumar drew flak over promoting gutka brand. The trio recently received notices from the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) for promoting tobacco brands.Notably, actors Akshay Kumar alongside Shah Rukh Khan and Ajay Devgn were seen in the advertisements of the brand Vimal. This sparked controversy, and Akshay Kumar resigned as Vimal’s brand ambassador last year after receiving criticism from his fans. Previously, he had signed up as a brand ambassador for the company’s Elaichi products. However, Vimal also makes tobacco products, and his endorsement of the brand was seen as an endorsement of those products. In October this year, Kumar refuted a media report claiming that he is returning as the brand ambassador for Vimal Pan Masala.Actors Shahrukh Khan, Akshay Kumar, Ajay Devgn, and Amitabh Bachchan received flak from fans over a commercial that aired featuring him back in 2021. Following the backlash, Bachchan withdrew from a pan-masala advertising campaign.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"16 December, 2023 ","Friends fame Matthew Perry died of ‘acute effects of Ketamine’, reveals autopsy",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/friends-actor-matthew-perry-died-of-ketamine-overdose/,"While releasing the autopsy report, the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner’s office said Matthew Perry died from the “acute effects” of ketamine, an anaesthetic with psychedelic properties.Hollywood actor, famed for portraying Chandler Bing in the popular sitcom Friends, Matthew Perry died because of ‘acute effects of Ketamine’, as per his autopsy report which was released on Friday (15th December). As per reports, the manner of death was ruled an ‘accident’.Actor Matthew Perry, best known for his role as Chandler Bing from ‘Friends,’ died from the ‘acute effects of ketamine,’ with drowning and heart disease found to be contributing factors, an autopsy report shows https://t.co/uI1QcqP06c pic.twitter.com/4WskJozViTWhile releasing the autopsy report, the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner’s office said Matthew Perry died from the “acute effects” of ketamine, an anaesthetic with psychedelic properties.As per reports, the effects of the drug combined with other factors, made the actor lose consciousness and drown in his hot tub leading to his death. The medical examiner’s office added that drowning, coronary artery disease, and the effects of an opioid, buprenorphine, had contributed to his death. However, his autopsy attributed his death primarily to “the acute effects of ketamine.” Ketamine is a potent anaesthetic and it has gained popularity as an alternative treatment for challenging mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and others. Additionally, it is also used recreationally. According to the autopsy report, Perry had been on ketamine infusion therapy. However, the report ruled out that the ketamine in his system could not have been from his last known therapy session, which was about a week and a half before he died. Perry had publicly struggled with drinking and drug use for decades. The autopsy report stated, “At the high levels of ketamine found in his postmortem blood specimens, the main lethal effects would be from both cardiovascular overstimulation and respiratory depression.” The report noted that the level of ketamine investigators found in Perry’s blood was equivalent to the amount that would be used during general anesthesia. However, the exact method of intake is unknown. Toxicology tests also revealed the presence of “therapeutic” levels of buprenorphine, a drug used to address drug addiction and manage pain. According to Perry’s live-in assistant, he was seeing a psychiatrist and taking prescribed buprenorphine twice a day. While investigators discovered signs of sedatives, they found no traces of alcohol, methamphetamine, or cocaine.The veteran Hollywood actor aka Chandler Bing died at the age of 54 on 29th October.

The Bachchan family is making headlines once more, but this time for all the wrong reasons. There have been long-running allegations that Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan are at odds, therefore, she reportedly moved out of the family residence and into her mother’s house. Aishwarya and Abhishek Bachchan had been struggling with the issues for years and now things have come to a crucial point.A source close to the family cited by Times Now divulged, “It is for their child that Abhishek and Aishwarya are still together. They have been having problems for years. Now matters have come to a head.” Aishwarya now splits her time between her mother and in-laws’ house where she and her husband remain in a completely separate and isolated section from other members of the family. According to numerous sources, she and her mother-in-law Jaya Bachchan have not spoken to each other in a few years and won’t even acknowledge each other’s existence. Abhishek finds himself entangled in the conflict between his obligations to his wife and children and his parents. The already tumultuous relationship has worsened since Jaya and Amitabh Bachchan’s daughter Shweta Nanda moved in permanently into Jalsa.Divorce doesn’t appear to be an option anytime soon, though. This is because prominent parties are involved and cannot afford to be associated with a scandal. Allegations that megastar Amitabh Bachchan unfollowed his daughter-in-law on Instagram sparked a lot of attention on the Internet earlier this month. This sparked a lot of conversation on social media where users shared strange theories regarding the rivalry between the Bachchan family.The claims of a family feud intensified after Amitabh Bachchan celebrated his eighty years old. Shweta posted a picture of her parents and their grandchildren Aaradhya Bachchan, Navya Naveli Nanda and Agastya Nanda with the comment, “May you always be surrounded by love,” on her official Instagram account. A post shared by S (@shwetabachchan)Aishwarya Rai Bachchan shared the same photo on social media but with a slight variation. She cut out Jaya Bachchan, Navya Naveli and Agastya Nanda and left just her father-in-law and daughter in the spotlight with the caption, “Always, God Bless.”A post shared by AishwaryaRaiBachchan (@aishwaryaraibachchan_arb)Aishwarya Rai and Abhishek Bachchan tied the knot in 2007 after a whirlwind relationship and had their only child Aaradhya in 2011.

"14 December, 2023 ","I am proud Muslim, I am proud Indian: Mohammed Shami slams Pakistani social media handles who tried to create ‘Sajda’ controversy during World Cup",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/i-am-proud-indian-mohammed-shami-slams-trollers-over-sajda-row/,"Mohammed Shami had kneeled down for a few moments after taking five wickets against Sri Lanka, after which many Pakistani social media users started saying that the Indian bowler wanted to offer a Sajda but did not do it due to fear.On Wednesday (13th December), Indian cricketer Mohammed Shami attended ‘Agenda Aaj Tak’. During his interview, he slammed the Pakistani social media handles who claimed that Shami stopped short of offering Sajda (prayer) on the ground in a match after taking the fifth wicket during the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023.The anchor asked Mohammed Shami, “In a match, you took the fifth wicket and sat down on the ground. Then some social media handles from Pakistan claimed that ‘See, Mohammed Shami – an Indian Muslim – wanted to offer Sajda (prayer) but suddenly he was afraid and could not do it’.”Mohammed Shami said, “If anyone wants to do Sajda, who will stop him? I won’t stop anyone from your religion from praying. You will not stop anyone from my religion from praying. If at all I want to do Sajda, I will do it anyway. What is the problem with it? I am a Muslim and I proudly say so. I am an Indian and I proudly say so.”Mohammed Shami added, “If at all I had any problem with that, I should not have lived in India in the first place. Had I needed anyone’s permission to offer my prayers in this country, I would not have lived here. People have said a lot of things and even I have seen those things on Instagram. People are saying that I wanted to do a Sajda but I could not. Brother, have I done anything of that sort on the ground ever in my life before? I had taken five wickets before as well. I did not do Sajda at that time.”Shami further said, “You tell me where I have to pray, and I will go and pray there. I will do it on every Indian platform I get. This is not done. We should change our thinking. These people think only about how to disturb us. They are not with me. Neither they are with you. They are not with anyone except gossiping. They do not love anyone and anything but gossip. All they need is content. They will take any content.”About the five-wicket haul in that match, Mohammed Shami said, “Do you know how I took those five wickets? It was probably my sixth over. I was bowling with an effort that exhausted my energy limits. I already had three wickets. I was thinking that if I bowl even better in these 3 to 4 remaining overs, I will get five wickets. Because I already had three wickets. All I was thinking about was giving my 100 per cent. And in fact, I was giving my 200 per cent at that time. I was bowling better than my abilities.”He further said, “I was tired. That batter was not getting out. I could beat him multiple times but he was not getting out. I was tired of this. When I got the fifth wicket I came on my knees. At that time, I lowered my neck. That’s it. People created different meanings out of that. These people are so free in their lives. I think they do not have anything else to do.”Notably, Mohammed Shami had kneeled down for a few moments after taking five wickets against Sri Lanka, after which many Pakistani social media users started saying that the Indian bowler wanted to offer a Sajda but did not do it due to fear. Shami completed a five-wicket haul by dismissing Kasun Rajitha in the 13th over of the Sri Lankan innings. Shami took 24 wickets in seven matches – the most by any bowler in the tournament.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"16 December, 2023 ",Central Consumer Protection Authority to publicly ‘name and shame’ companies and establishments running misleading advertisements,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/govt-to-publicly-name-and-shame-companies-and-establishments-running-misleading-ads/,"Orders and notices issued against establishments running misleading ad campaigns, like coaching institutes, and service providers, will soon be displayed on the official websites of the CCPA and its nodal Ministry.As part of a crackdown on misinformation spread by advertisers, the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) is planning to make information public about the establishments and brands that are running misleading advertisements, Mint reported on Saturday (16th December) citing officials. In a statement, the CCPA stated that they will soon be “naming and shaming” companies that are publishing misleading ads to discourage such practices, as reported by Mint.As per reports, the orders and notices issued against establishments running misleading ad campaigns, like coaching institutes, and service providers, will soon be displayed on the official websites of the CCPA and its nodal Ministry. Notably, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution is the Nodal Ministry of India’s consumer protection authority. As per the current working procedure of CCPA, the authority did not publicly disclose the information of the companies or establishments that run misleading ads. However, it is now planning to display their names on the CCPA website so that the consumers will be alerted to make informed decisions. Additionally, the Nodal Ministry is also planning to conduct a study to evaluate the impact of the CCPA’s new guidelines on the public, officials cited by Mint stated. The report further added that these measures are being taken to eliminate misinformation spread by certain corporations regarding their services. As per the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, for any product or service, misleading advertisement pertains to any advertisement, that— (i) falsely describes such product or service; or (ii) gives a false guarantee to, or is likely to mislead the consumers as to the nature, substance, quantity or quality of such product or service; or (iii) conveys an express or implied representation which, if made by the manufacturer or seller or service provider thereof, would constitute an unfair trade practice; or (iv) deliberately conceals important information.It is important to note that the CCPA had earlier issued 20 notices to IAS coaching centres for allegedly running misleading advertisements. As per reports, the authority issued a warning to all coaching centres. Apart from the warning, heavy penalties were imposed on eight of these institutes. The information was given by the Union Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey in a written reply on 13th December in the Lok Sabha. However, the authority didn’t reveal the names and locations of these IAS coaching institutes to the general public.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"16 December, 2023 ",Committee to be formed on the issue of converted tribals receiving dual benefits in the state: Maharashtra Government,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/maharashtra-govt-to-address-matter-of-converted-tribals-who-get-dual-benefits/,"The panel would be presided over by the vice-chancellor of a university and would consist of members from all political parties who would look into cases of tribal (Janjati/Vanvasi) conversionOn 14th December, Maharashtra minister Mangal Prabhat Lodha stated in the legislative council that a committee would be constituted to examine the advantages enjoyed by members of scheduled tribes (ST) community in Maharashtra who have converted to Christianity or Islam and left Hinduism. The issue would be presented to Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, Deputy CMs Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar. The panel would be presided over by the vice-chancellor of a university and would consist of members from all political parties who would look into cases of tribal (Janjati/Vanvasi) conversion. The minister remarked that the committee would look into the concerns mentioned by Bhartiya Janta Party MLA Niranjan Davkhare and present a report in 45 days.He was reacting to an appeal to action made by BJP lawmakers Niranjan Davkhare and Pravin Darekar who demanded that tribal people who embraced Islam or Christianity be removed from the ST list and that their right to reservation be terminated. The BJP lawmaker had earlier argued that the Janjati members who had converted were receiving benefits intended for scheduled tribes and minorities during the debate on the de-listing of those Janjati community members who had switched to other faiths.The Minister of Tourism, Skill Development and Entrepreneurship also voiced worry about the rising number of reported cases of forced and inducement conversions among tribe members and asserted that these actions undermine tribal culture.However, the opposition leaders who contended that members of scheduled tribes have the right to choose their religion and that the planned de-listing process would result in religious discrimination engaged in a contentious debate over the matter. Congress legislator Kapil Patil claimed that the proposed delisting would amount to prejudice based on faith and alleged that members of a Scheduled Tribe have the right to pick their religion. According to him, if the indigenous people convert to Hinduism it becomes acceptable (for those looking to delist them upon conversion) but if they convert to Islam, Christianity or Buddhism, it is not approved.Notably, there have been many allegations of the unlawful conversion of Janjati community members through coercion and seduction that have surfaced regularly. This included conversion that is pushed by deception and false promises of financial assistance, jobs, education and health care. Furthermore, numerous reports of conversions that occur in the Janjati-dominated districts of Bharat involve the provision of rations and the enticement of innocent girls from the community by concealing true identities.It is important to note that the Janjati community in several Indian states has been taking to the streets in support of a national delisting initiative to find members of the community who have converted to another religion but still possess a scheduled tribe certificate and are eligible to use the reservation’s benefits. Numerous comparable demonstrations have also taken place in Maharashtra, where the Janjati group makes up a sizeable 9% of the state’s population.Sharad Chauvhan, the Janjati Suraksha Manch’s media coordinator previously conveyed during his talk on the subject that the Janjati society has organised up to 231 rallies throughout various states to support the cause of delisting and that a nationwide delisting exercise is urgently needed. He stressed, “Our demand is clear, those who have converted to any religion other than those originated in Bharat should not avail the benefits exclusively reserved for the Janjatis.”The desire for delisting is one of the long-standing issues facing the tribal community and many of its leaders have been observed expressing support for it. This includes legendary figures like Baba Kartik Oraon who backed the idea of a national identity program to protect the rights granted only to the tribal community.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"16 December, 2023 ","Mumbai police arrest one Dildar Hussain Ali from Assam for sextortion of a woman, around 2,500 people had gathered to protect him",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/mumbai-police-nab-sextortion-accused-dildar-hussain-ali-in-assam/,"When the police team arrived in the Assam village on Tuesday, around 2500 individuals had assembled to assist accused Dildar Hussain Ali in evading capture.On Thursday (14th December), Mumbai police arrested a 23-year-old man named Dildar Hussain Ali from Assam after conducting a day-long search in a forest in Assam’s Sonitpur district for recording a nude video of a victim from Andheri (East) and subsequently using it to extort money. When the police team arrived in the village on Tuesday, around 2500 individuals had assembled to assist accused Dildar Hussain Ali in evading capture. Over the past year, the accused coerced a minimum of Rs 1 lakh from the victim by fabricating a false Instagram account and using it to upload a video for blackmail.Dildar Hussain Ali – a school drop-out – possessed the technical know-how to record WhatsApp Video Calls. He utilized this skill to compel the 20-year-old victim, who was a graduate, to undress during the video call. A police officer from the MIDC Seepz police station in Andheri (East) Mumbai said, “Initially, the police team was in a dilemma about where to head first on tracking his location, shown in Assam and Kerala. The team then decided to head to Assam, where Ali was arrested after a day-long search of the jungle.”This case was filed in the MIDC Seepz police station in Andheri (East) Mumbai on 30th November 2023. The victim woman who works in a firm in Andheri was fed up with the frequent blackmailing and harassment from the accused. Accused Dildar Hussain Ali forced her to transfer money to his bank account.A police officer said, “The complainant had come in contact with Ali a few months ago on a social media platform. He befriended her, promised marriage and started chatting on video call. He forced her to do obscene acts and recorded them. He then created a fake social media account and uploaded these videos. Even after she filed a complaint, Ali demanded money to not circulate these videos further.”In her complaint, the victim woman said, “The blackmailing began after I rejected his marriage proposal when I learned that the accused whom I befriended on social media as Dildar Khan is a school dropout and unemployed. This annoyed him and started posting the video screenshot which he recorded that he captured during our intimate chats.”DCP Datta Nalawade led the supervisory role for the team, which included ACP Dr Shashikant Bhosale, MIDC Police Senior Inspector Satish Gaikwad, Inspector Tukaram Koyande, Sub-Inspector Pramod Khotwad, and supporting staff. This team successfully traced the accused to Assam.A police officer said, “Ali’s parents took the villagers’ help to get him to escape on learning that the police team had arrived in Assam to arrest him. Around 2500 villagers gathered outside Ali’s house. The team took the superintendent of police’s help in Assam to comb out the entire jungle which lasted over 12 hours before he was nabbed.” The accused was arrested on Thursday.Dildar Hussain Ali has been booked under the Indian Penal Code and Information Technology Act for sexual harassment, defamation, and computer-related offences among others.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"16 December, 2023 ","‘Judge Sahab, please have mercy…’: Mafia Mukhtar Ansari pleads before court for threatening witness in coal trader murder case",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/mafia-mukhtar-ansari-pleads-before-court-after-conviction-in-nand-kishore-rungta-murder-case/,"A Varanasi MP/MLA court sentenced mafia-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari to five and a half years in prison for threatening a witness in the kidnapping of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad treasurer. On Friday (December 15), a Varanasi MP/MLA court sentenced mafia-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari to five and a half years in prison for threatening a witness in the kidnapping of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad treasurer. The court also fined Ansari Rs 10,000 for threatening Mahavir Prasad Rungta, the brother of coal businessman and VHP treasurer Nand Kishore Rungta, who was kidnapped from his Varanasi office on January 22, 1997. This is the jailed mafia’s seventh conviction since September last year.Mukhtar Ansari, who was visibly upset after hearing the ruling, reportedly began pleading with the judge. Mukhtar Ansari sat with his head down and his hands on his forehead as soon as the sentence was pronounced by the court. Following this, Ansari appealed to the judge, saying, ‘Judge Sahab, please have mercy so that all my sentences proceed simultaneously.’ However, in the decision given by the court, it was already mentioned.Nand Kishore Rungta, a coal businessman from Jawahar Nagar of Bhelupur police station area of Varanasi, was murdered after beingkidnapped on January 22, 1997. Reports say that Nand Kishore was killed even after the family paid a ransom of Rs 1.25 crore to the kidnapper. After this, on the evening of November 5, 1997, Nand Kishore Rungta’s brother Mahavir Prasad Rungta, a witness in the case, received bomb threats on his landline not to file a complaint with the police.A case in this regard was registered at Bhelupur police station on December 1 of that year on Mahavir Rungta’s complaint. After the investigation, the police presented the charge sheet against Mukhtar Ansari before the court on July 3, 1998.  “Mukhtar threatened to bomb our home if we did not stop pursuing the case of kidnapping of my brother before the CBI. The CBI probe into the Rungta kidnapping case had already been accepted on the application of his wife,” Mahavid Rungta had said in his complaint. In the last 15 months, Ansari has been convicted in seven cases. In the same vein, a Varanasi court convicted Mukhtar on Friday for threatening the Rungta family. The erstwhile gangster was connected via video conferencing during the hearing. Following the hearing, Ansari was sent to the solitary barrack. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

On Monday (December 11), a man named Ashwajit Gaikwad allegedly mowed down his girlfriend under his SUV in Thane, Maharashtra. Victim Priya Singh was seriously injured after he allegedly crashed his Land Rover Defender into her on Ovala Road in Thane’s Ghodbunder area. The accused is the son of Anil Gaikwad, the Managing Director of the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation. According to the victim, she and the accused were in a relationship for four and a half years.Taking to her Instagram account, the victim, who is currently hospitalised, shared her pictures after sustaining multiple injuries and also posted a note revealing the details of the incident. The victim said that on early Monday morning, her boyfriend Ashwajit called her to meet him while he was at a function along with his friends. Priya went to meet the accused who she claims was behaving strangely. The victim said that she tried to talk to him in private, however, Ashwajit’s friend Romil Patil did not let them talk. The situation escalated into a heated argument, the victim claimed, and Ashwajit, along with his friends, began hurling verbal abuses at the victim. When Priya asked her boyfriend to defend her, he allegedly slapped and tried to strangulate her.“My boyfriend slapped me, tried to strangle my neck. I tried to push him away he bit my hand, beat me, pulled by hair and his friend out of nowhere pushed me to the ground,” Priya wrote.A post shared by PRIYA SINGH (@priyasingh_official)Meanwhile, Ashwajit’s friends Romil Patil, Prasad Patil, and Sagar Shelke also joined him in attacking the victim. As the situation started getting worse, she headed to retrieve her bag and phone from the SUV, but the perpetrators allegedly attempted to cause her serious harm by first driving the SUV into her back near a divider, then returning and driving it over her right leg before speeding away.“While they got into the car and started moving, I realised that my phone and purse was in the car. As soon as I reached the door of the Range Rover, I heard him (Ashwajit Gaikwad) say ‘uda de isko’ (ram into her) to his driver Sagar. He sped up immediately and I fell to the ground as I was hit by the left side of the car, after which he drove the rear left wheel over my right leg.” The bone below her right knee got fractured from the impact and required surgical intervention. Gaikwad’s driver Sagar also threatened her not to complain about the incident while taking her to the hospital saying that “Chichi Bhai” [Ashwajit Gaikwad] comes from a well-connected and influential family, the victim wrote.In her post, Singh has tagged Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, Union Minister Smriti Irani, Shiv Sena-UBT leader Aditya Thackeray, and other political leaders.Meanwhile, the Kasarvadavali police have lodged a case against Ashwajit, Shelke, Romil and Prasad Patil based on victim Priya Singh’s complaint, however no arrests have been made so far. The victim has alleged that police are not making arrests in the matter since the accused persons have links with influential people. Meanwhile, the victim’s post has gone viral on social media. The accused were booked under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 279 (rash driving on a public way) and 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) of the Indian Penal Code.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

On this day, let us salute the courage & fortitude displayed by the Indian Armed Forces.”Vijay Diwas is celebrated on December 16 to commemorate India’s victory over Pakistan in the 1971 war. December 16, 1971, was the day when Pakistan signed the instrument of surrender in Dhaka, following a 13-day India-Pakistan War. With the surrender of over 93,000 soldiers, the Pakistan Army’s capitulation against Indian forces was complete. Following this decisive victory, India announced itself as a major regional force.Pakistan and the creation of Bangladesh was a devastating event for West Pakistan, the aftershocks of which continue to this day. Along with the physical fall of Dacca, Pakistan was also defeated psychologically. The two-nation theory, that Muslims of the subcontinent formed a nation, was demolished. Pakistan is still searching for a rationale for the dismemberment. For India, this battle is considered a historical occurrence. Because of this, December 16 is commemorated nationwide as “Vijay Diwas” to honour India’s triumph over Pakistan. According to reports, 3,900 Indian soldiers are believed to have died and 9,851 have been injured during the Battle of 1971. (This news report is published from a syndicated feed.
